At least 8 passengers and crew were injured during the attack and co-pilot, Yoram Peres, died of his wounds a month later. The plane was severely damaged.

An Italian customs agent dies in the terminal during the capture of the five Italians. After Lebanese authorities refused to let the plane land, it landed in Athens, where the terrorists demanded the release of 2 Arab terrorists. In order to make Greek authorities comply with their demands, the terrorists killed a hostage and threw his body onto the tarmac.   The plane then flew to Damascus, where it stopped for two hours to obtain fuel and food. It then flew to Kuwait, where the terrorists released their hostages in return for passage to an unknown destination. The Palestine Liberation Organization disavowed the attack, and no group claimed responsibility.

The National Transportation Safety Board determined the plane was destroyed by a bomb in the cargo hold, which caused structural failure resulting in uncontrollable flight.   Forty-nine passengers boarded the plane in Tel Aviv for Italy and the United States. They included 17 Americans (plus a baby), 13 Japanese, 4 Italians, 4 French, 3 Indians, 2 Iranians, 2 Israelis, 2 Sri Lankans, an Australian and a Canadian.

The flight was en route from Athens to Rome and then scheduled to terminate in London. The hijackers were seeking the release of 700 Shi'ite Muslims from Israeli custody.   Some passengers were threatened and some beaten. United States Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem was killed, and his body was thrown onto the tarmac.

Ten minutes after takeoff, three Palestinian gunmen hijacked the aircraft. The terrorists, calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were armed with guns and grenades. During the initial hijacking an Egyptian Security Service agent opened fire, killing one terrorist instantly before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the fuselage was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to 14,000 feet (4,300 m) to allow the crew and passengers to breathe. The ailing plane was diverted to land in Malta.   The chief hijacker threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. An Israeli woman, Nitzan Mendelson and an American, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp, were executed.   On 25 November, the storming of the aircraft by the Egyptian Al-Sa'iqa (Thunderbolt) unit -- Task Force 777 -- killed 54 out of the remaining 87 passengers, two crew members and one hijacker. A total of 58 out of the 95 passengers and crew had died and 2 out of the 3 hijackers by the time the crisis was over.
