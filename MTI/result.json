Last night we were talking about going to his grandmas house for Christmas which is 7 hours away.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) At first he invited me and I said yes I’d come, then we were talking about making a pit stop to see my family which is on the way, and he said he will ride with his brothers (to avoid going to see my family And I planned driving separately), then all of a sudden he says it would be one less thing to worry about if I don’t come because he has to plan sleeping arrangements and such.\n(2) So I told him I felt uncomfortable coming and that I was a burden and he is trying to tell me I’m bent out of shape about it and deliberately misinterpreting what he said.\n(3) Yes, I’ve met them and spent Christmas with them last year.\n(4) Why would he say that if he wanted me to spend Christmas with him and his family?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

My mother was diagnosed with inoperable cancer 4 years ago, and passed away within 5 months of diagnoses. It was a rough 5 months as my father and I did the majority of the caretaking for her. At the same time a woman I've known since I was 14, (we were in our early 30s at this point), had a pet die. It happened the same night I found out my mother had brain tumors. I tried to let her know I felt bad about her pet, but I had my own thing going on and couldn't be there for her. She insisted on calling me anyway to talk about her cat. Annoying, but my mom wasn't dead yet and my friends beloved pet was. I let it go. Fast forward 5 months. My mother just died. I haven't been talking to my friend much because I've either been busy or exhausted. And a bit I was dodging her calls because all she ever talked about were her cats. But she wants to come to the funeral since she knew my mom and really cared for her. I let her know when and where and that she's welcome to come back to the house for the close friends and family get together after the reception. She showed up at the church the funeral was at and I just couldn't shake her. After the service there was a reception and she followed me around it, talking to me about cats and complaining about living with her father. There were over 200 people at the service, my mom was well liked by her community. Most of them wanted to offer their condolences and as they did my friend kept awkwardly going on about her problems in the background. At one point I managed to slip away from my friend to have a smoke outside and she tracked me down. It was at that point I told her for the second time I really needed a break from the cat talk, and suggested she go say hi to her brothers family. She came back to my side as soon as she could and continued on about the cats for the rest of the day. It was infuriating.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) She flipped out, sent a lot of insulting messages, engaged with name calling.\n(2) I just blocked her numbers and haven't spoken to her since.\n(3) The next day I blocked her from my social media and sent her a text saying I didn't appreciate her behavior and needed some time and space from our friendship.\n(4) I just wonder if I was overreacting out of grief, exhaustion, all the heaviness that comes with caring for a dying relative.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

So for some backstory, I am currently a Freshmen and I know this girl through school and we have only known each other for a few months (Maybe 3-4 months). It all started out with my friend giving her my number (I don't know why). She starts to text me asking to give her something to do while she waits at an airport as she is going somewhere for winter break. Me being as funny as I am. I sent her a gif of Thanos snapping to keep her busy for a while so she wouldn't bother me. A few minutes later she once again complains about being bored, so I send her a gif of Peter Parker being turned to dust. That keeps her busy for a while and she doesn't text me for the rest of the night. We talk the next day about basic shit like \"Is there any homework for this class?\" and stuff like that. &amp;#x200B; The next day it gets weird. Me being on winter break at the time I was going to sleep around 2am-ish and waking up at 1pm-ish. At 5:48 am she texts me the following (keep in mind that we have only known each other for 3-4months) \"It's like 5 in the morning or whatever there and this is really weird but please don't think anything cause I was forced to do this: Are you big? Oh yeah, there was another one too: Do you actually masturbate or is it a joke?\" She then texted me at 6:02 am she texts me \"Sorry for those please just answer them though I gotta get the stuff.\" Then at 7:50 am she texts me \"I'm bored, My sister is taking too long.\" Then the last texts I received until I woke up and texted her back was \"Nevermind don't answer those forget about it I figured it out so its fine.\" &amp;#x200B; So I wake up to these texts and are bewildered by all these very weird texts, but me, being a Freshmen thinking I might get some ass, I question why she wants that info and she said: \"I can't because last time I got in trouble.\" She then said, \"I can't tell you because last time my sister over-reacted and my whole family hated me and they made me sit there kneeling on my knees pleading for three hours and I could barely stand I had to crawl around for like 4 day.\" I brushed it off as her not telling me the real reason, so I go ahead and tell her and she says \"Meh\". We continue to talk normally for the rest of the day and most of the days following. &amp;#x200B; Many days after this she starts to bring up if I have sexual fantasies and what are they. Another very confusing/private question. I just ignore it and she doesn't try to pry and keep asking if I do; until the next day which she keeps prying and I say \"These are completely uncomfortable topics and I am not willing to answer.\" and she gets pretty mad, calling me a liar and other not very nice names. People might wonder why I haven't blocked her yet, but again I thought I might be getting some ass. She then gets very nosy and keeps asking once again and I threaten to block her, so I do and I thought that was the end of it. Multiple days later, after winter break, she starts texting me on a number I have not blocked and keeps asking about it.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA for making her cry after I didn't give her private info?\n(2) So I almost instantly block her number.\n(3) Later that week during school I see her crying and all the private info during that conversation got leaked, so I started to tell people what she had asked and everything she had done and once again today I saw her crying.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

She ended up going to a couple of my close friends asking if they could hook her up with a gram. My friends knew who she was so they contacted me and asked if they should or not. I told them no and that was the end of that. Then she asked them again... and again... in which case i WARNED her that i would tell our parents if she didnt stop because... well she is 13, and i firmly believe that anyone under the age of 16 shouldn't even consider touching ANY drug. Then she asked me and my friend again, this time i decided to scam her for $15 dollars since i really didn't want to tell our parents (I'm 17 so i didn't really want to admit i smoked). She is getting her money back because i don't like scamming a family member (or anyone for that matter). But thats besides the point. She ended up finding another friend of mine selling xanax and weed, he told me he met a customer that looked an awful lot like me. I asked if her name was (her name) and he said yes. That was my last straw, i decided 2 hours ago to call up my mom, tell her everything that had happened and that i want her to set her straight without involving police ect. Ofc, somehow she wasnt surprised about me smoking but was really upset that my 13 year old sister was. She ends up giving me a 40min talk about harm reduction and alot of what she said i already knew but made alot of sense.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) After that, my sister calls me an asshole, and threatens to snitch on me to the police.\n(2) At this point i don't care but i feel like i may have made the wrong decision.\n(3) She calls my little sister, and my sister ends up calling my mom \"unsupportive\" and \"a horrible mother\".\n(4) My mom started crying and was almost late to her job.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

That was my last straw, i decided 2 hours ago to call up my mom, tell her everything that had happened and that i want her to set her straight without involving police ect.\n\n(2) Ofc, somehow she wasnt surprised about me smoking but was really upset that my 13 year old sister was. She ends up giving me a 40min talk about harm reduction and alot of what she said i already knew but made alot of sense.\n\n(3) Then she asked them again... and again... in which case i WARNED her that i would tell our parents if she didnt stop because... well she is 13, and i firmly believe that anyone under the age of 16 shouldn't even consider touching ANY drug.\n\n(4) After that, my sister calls me an asshole, and threatens to snitch on me to the police.\n\n(5) At this point i don't care but i feel like i may have made the wrong decision.\n\n(6) She is getting her money back because i don't like scamming a family member (or anyone for that matter). But thats besides the point.\n\n(7) My friends knew who she was so they contacted me and asked if they should or not. I told them no and that was the end of that.\n\n(8) She ended up going to a couple of my close friends asking if they could hook her up with a gram.\n\n(9) My mom started crying and was almost late to her job.\n\n(10) She asked me and my friend again, this time i decided to scam her for $15 dollars since i really didn't want to tell our parents (I'm 17 so i didn't really want to admit i smoked).\n\n(11) Throwaway obviously. Recently my sister started smoking hash/weed.\n\n(12) She asked them again... and again... in which case i WARNED her that i would tell our parents if she didnt stop because... well she is 13, and i firmly believe that anyone under the age of 16 shouldn't even consider touching ANY drug.\n\n(13) Then she asked me and my friend again, this time i decided to scam her for $15 dollars since i really didn't want to tell our parents (I'm 17 so i didn't really want to admit i smoked).\n\n(14) She calls my little sister, and my sister ends up calling my mom \"unsupportive\" and \"a horrible mother\".\n\n**Task 2**\nUse your answer for step#1 as a source sequence.

My relationship with my mother isn't good due to our vastly different personalities, she is very loud and stuff while I'm in the quiet side like my dad. My mom likes to announce every single thing she does while I just do it without making a big fuss about it, be it greeting other people, doing chores around the house, etc. Worth to mention that her whole family is like this and I'm also not on good terms with them because of these reasons but also worse stuff. Yesterday we went to my nanny's house. She's pretty sick atm so I proposed to go and I brought some fruits and money for her medical needs. She lives with her daughter and her kids so when we got there I went and greeted all of them, just a simple \"Hey [redacted] *hugs*\" I did this with every person in the house, cause basic manners and I'm pretty close with the family. When we got to my nanny's room, my mother announced why we were there while simultaneously asking everyone if I had say hi to then \" *Did Frisk greet you? She never greets anyone, don't know what I did wrong while rising her* \" Repeat this for almost 7 people looking extremely uncomfortable. At the end of the visit, my parents were already outside nanny's room while I gave her the money inside an envelope, as discreet as possible cause I know she hates getting money \"that she didn't work for\". When I got out my parents were outside the house and my mother screamed *DID YOU GIVE HER THE MONEY?* I think that every single person in the block heard it and I was so embarrassed and upset because she made such a trashy action in a pretty sensible moment. She also did the *Did Frisk say goodbye to you?* for every single person in the house, again. It's not the first time she does this, but it was so upsetting this time because I feel she ruined a quiet and special visit with someone I truly care about. When we got home I told her that I felt terrible because she was always treating me like a child and also making a big fuss over every single thing I did or didn't do and she just said \" Well, you're always silent with everything you do and I have to make sure you're behaving correctly.\" ??? Then I told her that just because I wasn't loud as her and her whole family doesn't mean I'm not doing what I'm supposed to, that there's no need for me to be loud about things and that I've always been quiet, that I just couldn't understand why she was so obsessed with me being like her family, that it wasn't gonna happen and that I was glad I have no ties to such a terrible family (I am adopted) Then she said a lot of stuff surrounding my \"hate\" towards her family and that if I'm against her family, I'm also against her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Hurt feelings ensues.\n(2) TL;DR My mother treats me like a child and expects me to act like her and her family, situation escalates to me telling her that's not gonna happen.\n(3) So that's my question, AITA?\n(4) She hasn't talked to me since last night and I feel that I did nothing wrong, but my dad told me that it was disrespectful of me talking to my mother like that.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

When I take too many of my anxiety pills/antidepressants, I start having horrible symptoms like hallucinations, disphoria, dizziness, and a lot more (It's only a specific one, not all of them). I don't usually take them at all. But, I took it because I get anxiety in tight spaces. Basically, we were having a road trip. We all took turns driving my dad's old van. I took four of my pills because I forgot about the other two that I took. I mentioned this to everyone but they still wanted me to drive. It started getting worse while driving. I was fading in and out, everyone laughing at me sounded like Alvin from the chimpmunks movie. I just wasn't feeling it. They told me that I was saying random things and that I started to act intoxicated. Then, fast forward, it was dark and I thought I saw myself jump in front of the car or something. So, you guessed it, I swerved extremely fast. I ended up crashing the car into a post. I don't remember much after that. They called the cops I guess. The told the cop everything. I went to the hospital temporarily. They let me out because I didn't want to go to rehab or anything. Fast forward, everyone is butt hurt about it and I couldn't care less. All of them keep throwing sneak disses my way and giving snarky remarks like, 'Don't take too many of your pills this time.', 'Is it okay for you to drive or are you gonna attempt to murder us again.' (All of this was today).\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I even warned all of them about the bad symptoms when I take too much.\n(2) I just wanted to ask Reddit if I was actually even in the wrong with any of this.\n(3) They've witnessed many incidents with me on my medication.\n(4) They know I have anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

My friend and me were on a vacation at the seaside where we met a guy (let's call him Dave). He was a cool guy overall so we kept contact for about 1-2 years. Fast forward 3 years my UNI made a picnic party. The day arrived and when I came there Dave was there and he brought a girl with him (let's call her Anna). So she was cute but a bit messy. With her dark hair, dark eyeliners and overall small figure not to mention extremly shy, she caught my eye. So we sat down at the same table, talked, drank etc. like every picnic party goes. Then it was time for chestnuts, so we gathered around the fire. We were all just chilling there having small talk when suddenly I feel someone squeezing to me. I looked and it was Anna. A bit drunk but still not too badly, so I decided sure we can cuddle andd put my arm around her. Then the chestnuts were ready so we sat back down and ate them. Shortly after we decided to go home, so we packed a bit of booze for the walk home. Anna then wanted us to walk together and so we did. We escorted a 4th guy. Next up was Dave, and so we went towards his flat and when we arrived there he didn't want to go to sleep yet so we sat on a nearby bench and spent some time there. Then Anna drew out weed and said let's smoke it and so she started. I felt so bad because I had quit smoking weed for quite some time and this gril that was so promising was smoking it. A little backstory for weed as well I suppose. I also have a 4 years older brother and there was a scandal involving weed that I don't want to get into details which made me quit. Anyways so she passed it to Dave and he passed it to me. We drank our leftovers and then Dave decided to go to sleep. So now only Anna was left to escort. We walked slowly to her appartment and we were flirting all the way. When we arrived she was glowing of happiness and it made me feel special as well. So we stood there a while and made out when she invited me in. That's when it hit me. I've felt shivers go down my spine and I started to do whatever I could just to not get there with her, since I knew we would both regret it after. After a while I actually managed to say good night even tho I saw her sad. I then walked to my dorm which was like 40 mins from there so i had time to think everything through and decided to sleep over it.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I did saw her some times at UNI after that and I still do (now she has a boyfriend) but she's ignoring me like I was air.\n(2) The next day however I felt so much guilt cause I had broken my only rule that I ever made: to never smoke weed again.\n(3) I shocked from my actions was trying to avoid any further contact with her, so after a few days of avoiding with lies I spit out the biggest lie of all: there's another girl and I never heard from her again.\n(4) Anna tho was very excited in the morning to see me again.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Will put spoiler tags. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR: &gt;!My whole family is mad at me for yelling at my cousin after she tried to take over my wedding. I also said my fiancé, whom she is in love with, would never love her. No one is letting me see her and apologize. &amp;#x200B; To make this easier to follow, my fiancé will be Jay, and my cousin will be Lisa. &amp;#x200B; My fiancé Jay (M24) and I (F24) have been together for 10 years. We have never doubted the other in our relationship ever. We have a great relationship. Lisa (F21) and I have an okay relationship. We did grow up together, but we just never clicked. &amp;#x200B; Now this happened when she was a senior in high school and Jay and I were 21. I went home for the holidays with Jay to celebrate Christmas with my family. During dinner, I overheard Lisa telling another cousin of ours that she wanted to fuck Jay. I confronted her later, but she said it was a joke. Last year at another Christmas gathering I went to with Jay, she told my aunt she was in love with Jay. I felt bad for her, so I didn't confront her this time. That night, Jay proposed. I saw Lisa crying and running upstairs to the bathroom. &amp;#x200B; Flash forward to now. Our parents, Jay and I are planning our wedding. I specifically told my family that it was only going to be us 6 planning the wedding, no one else. My aunt argued with me to let Lisa on the planning committee since Lisa wants to be a wedding planner in the future. I eventually agreed. &amp;#x200B; I really regret letting her on the committee. Let me list the things she's done so far: * Wanted to take control of the catering. All the food choices, cake, table covers, napkins, utensils, etc. * Wanted to pick out my dress. I said no to her pick, then the started to pout. * Wanted to pick out the bridesmaid dresses. She said she wanted this specific dress because it looked good on her. She's not even one of my bridesmaids. * Wanted to have a big wedding. I said no since both Jay and I wanted an intimate wedding with only family and close friends. &amp;#x200B; Last week we were having another family gathering, and Lisa would not stop gushing about how perfect the wedding was going to be. Then she listed everything Jay and I picked out saying it was all HER idea. The more lies that came out of her mouth, I got angrier. &amp;#x200B; I snapped and started to yell at her. I said how it wasn't her wedding, it was mine, and I could plan it however I pleased. I also said how he loved me and he would never love her. She burst into tears and ran upstairs to cry. I realized how hurtful the things I said was and went to go apologize, but my family stopped me. They told me I should just let her plan the wedding and let Jay go talk to her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Reddit, AITA?\n(2) &amp;#x200B;\n(3) I honestly felt really bad and tried to apologize, but no one would let me.\n(4) Even Jay thinks I took it too far.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

He took my headphones and threw them out so I couldnt use my phone (I need headphones for a lot of the things I do) and ran off with it. I continuously attacked him in his texts and threatened him by saying I'd disown him or I'd kill him, stuff like that. After about an hour, I find where he put it. He put it in a closet on top of a bottle and the shelves had holes in them , and since he hid it on the top level. When I went to get it, it was gone. The headphones disappeared in the health products and towels in the closet. My mom said that she said that he wasnt allowed to have dinner until he found it (it was 7:00 and we knew he wouldnt find it for a few hours). I had the chance to say no, but I didnt. I wanted to have him have revenge. So now I just took away my brother's dinner and had him do a pointless search since I took my old headphones that work. Not only that, but hes sick and has a fractured knee.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) And I also attacked him.\n(2) It's been a while since I lost it and now his only dinner is a glass of milk.\n(3) I took away his food while was sick she had a broken knee, but he did take my phone and he lost my headphones.\n(4) He did just find them as I'm typing this but he wont talk to me.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

X was devastated and went to talk about their break up with another friend of ours, we'll call him \"R\". B talked with R about how he was still madly in love with her and how he couldn't bear to be away from her and all, he cried in front of him and told him his deepest feelings. Recently though, I found out that R had been getting on with B's ex in the same week of the break up. B would arrive in the afternoon to talk about his feelings and when he left, his ex arrived for the night. I was infuriated by this, especially knowing that they were trying to keep it a secret from everyone and that they might have been hooking up before the break up (she was visiting his house by herself semi-regularly about a month before it).

The group I hang out with aren’t necessarily my friends except for 3 of them (10 in the group).

The guys are very big dicks to everyone and I don’t associate with them at all. But in the past they weren’t dicks and we were my actual friends. I’ll refer to my friends as friends but will refer to the others as “friends” So they’re all below average when it comes to grades (D’s and C’s) whereas I’m a B’s and low A type of student. One of the “friends” is around 0.50% off from failing an English class which I also have (the rest have another teacher).\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I used to help most of them out when we were actually friends but now I don’t considering how stuff they do to me and other people.\n(2) So reddit am I the asshole for not helping him/them?\n(3) (All verbal rarely physical) I never say “no I won’t help you”\n(4) Or anything like that instead I’ll usually say something like “no I don’t know how to do that”\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

At the time I was 15, and he would often talk to me as a sort of 'therpist'. Around that time I started becoming more independent and isolated myself more from my family - a few years prior however, my dad and I were extremely close. I just took my growing independence as a normal feat of growing up. Anyways, so one day when I was 15 he was confiding in me about his depression, when suddenly he started confronting me about how I no longer spent time with him. Then he kinda got tearfully angry and told me that I'm the reason he is suicidal/I make him suicidal. This definitely bothered me at the time, but I was more resentful/angry than anything. I've remembered the incident quite clearly since then. Fast forward to today, my 18th birthday, and I'm sitting down with my parents at the table (a very rare occassion) and we're just talking. I definitely have alot of resentments towards my family and my upbringing (I come from a fairly dysfunctional family, and my upbringing has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster) and towards both parents, but I was actually enjoying myself while we were talking. Recently I asked to get an appointment with a psychiatrist and begin therapy again, as I've been struggling with what I think is worsening depression over the last few months. So we talked a bit about that. We talked a bit about how dysfunctional the family is, and reminisced about the tumultuous up bringing - but in a good light. It was kind of nice,and I actually felt close to them for the first time in years (especially my dad). I don't remember exactly what my dad said to me next (but I perceived it to be in an accusatory tone), so then I brought up the shitty thing he had said to me a few years prior - how he told me I make him suicidal. He vehemently denied this at first, claiming that he must have been talking to my mom (as he accuses her of that quite often) or that I was just remembering incorrectly, because he would have remembered saying that. I was insistent until I noticed him growing upset as he began to acknowledge that it may be true, at which point I admitted that it may have been a misunderstanding (which it was definitely not).\n###List of Sentences\n(1) It is definitely something that has remained ingrained in my.mind, and I've told my mom about it, but never brought it up with my dad.\n(2) This then triggered me, and now I'm in bed succing on a cigarette and feeling like a total asshole for having brought that up.\n(3) Now I'm worried that he is suicidal again.\n(4) My mom made us hug and then he burst into tears, very obviously hurt, and started lamenting about what a shitty thing that was/how he's a bad person.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

So to summarize what’s been going on for the passed 2 months, it’s been borderline illegal disputes and common courtesy thrown out the window. Basically she uses her friend’s death to excuse her from any responsibilities; she never cleans, never pays rent and bills on time , treats us all like shit, and constantly threatens suicide and almost brags about the amount of sleeping pills she takes a night in hopes she takes 1 pill too many and kicks the bucket. At first I tried to be there for her (especially after her friend’s suicide 2-3 months ago) and get her help but after she broke into my room just for the sake of spiting me, I have no genuine love for her anymore. I care about her wellbeing but I’m at my wits end with her. After she broke into my room I called her a cunt, a circus monkey following the loudest idiot leading her stupid parade, and that she needed to stay the fuck out of my room and to not touch/take my stuff or I would take her to court.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) She ran upstairs crying and screaming that I was an asshole.\n(2) Afterwards she accused me of not understanding her, that I lacked human emotions and understanding because I’m autistic, so I told her (was ex) boyfriend of 5 years shot himself not even a year ago and my best friend killed himself last year and I haven’t and still don’t pull the woe is me card.\n(3) Sorry for grammar, english is my second language.\n(4) She called me an asshole and I sarcastically told her I am what I eat and that would make her NyQuil.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Me and my current best friend and roommate met roughly 6 years ago at our first job(restaurant). Not too long after that she got promoted from a cashier, like me, to a supervisor position. At first it was a really nice gig having my friend be my “boss” simply because of favoritism. However that quickly turned around. As a few months went on she eventually became a manager and I began to notice a difference in how she had to treat me. I wasn’t just her friend but her employee and she didn’t want to get into trouble which I understood. Eventually I got another job at a small bakery in a grocery store and she moved to a different restaurant location with the same management position. After a few years of having to work at both places without having her there of course, I found it hard to get any sort of promotion, raise or recommendation from other management. Both places I was always seen as a good worker but never good enough for any type of higher up job. Towards the end of my time at the bakery I was being slowly cut hours and my boss was especially terrible to me which I still believe today was simply because I was young (I was the youngest out of a majority of older women) and school started taking up most of my time. I was struggling to pay rent and needed money badly and my friend had told me they needed help at the new restaurant where she helped manage. I saw it as a opportunity to make the money I desperately needed and applied. Again it was great at first but then not too long after she quit to focus on finishing her education. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to finally try and get that job promotion I always wanted! But to no surprise to me I didn’t get it... I met my current SO at the restaurant where he was also a supervisor. He later quit to get a better job and I was turned down for both positions. All of that happened within the past couple years and now I’m noticing it again. She ended up graduating and receiving a bachelor degree in hospitality. So she needed a job and so did I. It was my idea to go and apply at the hotel where me and her currently work. I wasn’t too fond of the whole idea from the beginning and I should have trusted my gut. It’s now been half a year we’ve both worked there. It’s a small hotel with only 100 rooms. There is also a small restaurant that’s part of the hotel. We both applied for the front desk job because it paid the most. She ended up getting the job while I was offered the job in the restaurant until another spot opened up at the front desk. So I took it because again I needed money for rent and school. At first it was nice because I was making not too bad money. Then my general manager’s true colors began to show. He gave me a bad impression from the start and I could tell he was not a fan of me and I wasn’t of him. He’s one of those solid tall guys with a beer gut who talks with a condescending tone to everyone he speaks to. Especially women. I asked for a couple months to switch job positions when I knew they needed help at the front desk. I was finally able to switch over to the job. However his office was connected to the back office where the front desk was so I had to work with him right there with me for 8 hours a day. I knew I was a great worker and guests would often tell me that I was too and let him know personally. He didn’t see it that way. He began to cut my hours and I ended up moving into the housekeeping department to keep my income steady. I didn’t mind it because I’d rather have less pay than deal with his terrible ass. Shit you not he told me in his office once “even if you’re (me) depressed (which I wasn’t just having a bad day) to just leave it at the door and to come into work with a smile”. Turned out I was great at housekeeping! So great in fact that my supervisor for that department wanted to promote me to be her assistant. Someone saw how much I care about my work and others and actually appreciated me enough to do so. But I couldn’t take it because once my school schedule started I couldn’t be there when I was needed... i was devastated and upset but I understood. Now my problem is that my best friend and roommate is once again receiving the assistant general manager position at the hotel. Part of me is happy for her because this is what she got her degree in and it’s better pay for her. But I’m mostly pissed that once again I’m at a job where she gets promoted and not me and I now have to talk to her like a boss and not just a friend. The GM and my friend get along fine. They’ve apparently been planning for months how to get rid of the AGM and let my friend take her place. One day he asked my friend if he should fire her before or after Christmas... like seriously wtf...The current AGM is a nice lady with two kids. She knows her job and has been there for years and does it fairly well. She was even texting my friend the other day to ask why the GM had been giving her the cold shoulder etc... she went ahead that same day and told him all about her texts to her and threw her under the bus. She plans on getting this position within the next couple weeks and with my hours once again being cut to just weekends I’m over this place and having her as my boss. She was texting me the other day not as my friend but as my “future boss” and to call work and talk to the GM. Which I hadn’t even received any texts, calls or emails from to do so. So I basically told her no. My supervisor has become unreliable and so has my GM.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I don’t trust my friend now when it comes to our conversations about work and I’ve already got an interview for a new job this Friday.\n(2) I’m ready to just quit with no explanation as soon as I get another job and she can explain awkwardly to the GM and my supervisor why I did.\n(3) We’re stuck being roommates for the next year too.\n(4) So reddit, can someone please tell me...AITA for wanting to do that to her and my job?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

He was also unhappy with his current job (truck driver) and since he was always interested in computers I started teaching him programming and got him an apprenticeship at the company I work at. After above mentioned things were dealt with, everyday life began to settle in again and I'd frequently visit him as usual. The difference now is that we don't have a dedicated room to chill in and play video games together and talk about private matters. Everything is now in the living room, with his gf visibly annoyed and more people visiting now since a good friend lives in the same apartment complex, so things get a lot easier heated nowadays. I'll be moving into a new place in 2 months and asked my friend if he wanted to help me with planning the apartment and such since he is experienced with that. He said yes and we waited until the floor plans arrived. I asked him multiple times when we wanted to go to some furniture places together to get some ideas (I wanted him to come with me since I want to make one of the rooms I'll have our dedicated place again, but this time I wanted it to be like a thing we designed and made together). He postponed the date when we would go multiple times because he either forgot it or wanted to stay home because he \"doesn't like to go to furniture places and just wants to chills at home\", which got me a little mad yesterday because he's on sick leave since two weeks (he isn't sick) and has been playing games since then (which imo is perfectly fine, but weakens his argument of wanting to chill imo). As soon as another friend came in and got wind about that we want to go to a furniture place, he immediately said that we should totally go now, but then realised it's late so we should go the next day then. I later called him out because that's not the first time this happened (like I asked him for something to do outside, he says no, but as soon as someone else would join, he says yes) and told him that I sort of feel disrespected as if I wasn't good enough of a reason to do something outside of his comfort zone.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I hope someone takes their time to read and reply to this.\n(2) Constructive feedback welcome, especially if I did something wrong.\n(3) He just replied \"dude, seriously?\" and now I'm sitting here wondering if I was wrong and the asshole for getting mad and / or overreacting or he is.\n(4) I'm not very good at socialising and would love to improve.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

My roommate and I talked and agreed to keep the air at 70-71 so that our electricity bill wouldn’t cost as much. It’s mostly remained at 71 because I try to be nice and I know she gets cold. Well, I at least try. Multiple times now, I’ve caught the air back up to 74 or 73, coming home after weekends away to a super hot apartment. Sometimes even if I’ve been in my room too long she will secretly raise the temperature despite our agreement. I have tolerated this for about two months now (we made the agreement in November, she began fringing on it in December). For awhile, I would just lower it back down to 71 and move on. But this week has had nice weather, to the point that without our air on, our apartments temperature has remained at 70 which is pretty damn nice, except she just raised the air to 72 right before bed. I would feel bad if it wasn’t for the fact she does nothing to help herself. She wears short sleeves in the apartment, no socks. She won’t use blankets or keep her door open at night to allow air to circulate. I just feel that if she is going to ignore our agreement then I will as well.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TLDR: Roommate and I agreed to keep temperature at 71, she keeps turning it up to 74.\n(2) We had talked about this once and it bothers me that I have to keep talking to her about the air.\n(3) So, will I be the asshole if I turn the air off at night (only on warmer nights) without my roommates knowledge?\n(4) Am I the asshole if I turn the air off at night?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit. So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex). I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening. I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk. So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n(2) No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n(3) I then leave and go to back to my room.\n(4) I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex). I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening. I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk. So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out.\n\nIn fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\nNo one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room.\n\nI told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done.\n\n<task2>N</task2/>\n\nTo calculate the minimum number of swaps required to change the source sequence to (1)-(2)-(3)-(4), I will count the number of swaps needed:\n\n(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) -> (1)-(2)-(4)-(3) -> (1)-(3)-(4)-(2) -> (1)-(3)-(2)-(4) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1)-(4)-(2)-(3) -> (1)-(4)-(3)-(2) -> (1",

Back story: years ago I had an account with Verizon wireless. At one point I called them to cancel the account which, as far as I was aware, was not under contract. They cancelled the account for me and then sent me a bill for around $900 in early termination fees and what not. The account went to collections as I argued with Verizon and then eventually they just stopped contacting me and it just sat on my credit report. Fast forward to today when I received a letter from the collection agency they sold my debt to. The letter basically said I could pay $300 to settle the account and have it removed from my report. Since I'm hoping to buy a house in the near future I figured I'd finally bite the bullet and just pay it and be done. I went to their website and entered the information provided to access my account and in reviewing it they have a place holder phone number and a birthday that is definitely not mine. The birthday they have listed would have made me 12 years old at the time the account was closed. Considering I had the account for 2-3 years that would mean I was 9 or 10 upon opening it.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA if I dispute the account even though I know it was mine?\n(2) In order to fix their mistake they want me to mail them a copy of my social security card, drivers license, AND birth certificate.\n(3) TL;DR: account went to collections during contract dispute, now the collection agency has incorrect personal information and Im considering disputing it to see if they'll remove it instead of paying.\n(4) It definitely has my name on it and to access it I had to verify my social.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Last year a kid (whom I'll call Jerry) joined the class. For most of that year myself and my friends never really talked to him. Then eventually we felt bad because he didn't really have no other friends. So, we decide to kind of add Jerry to the group. He seems happy enough and things were going fine until I added him to our group chat. That's when all hell broke loose. First, we had to add him to a separate one because one of my friends (whom I'll call Kat) HATED him. Whenever Jerry and her were together she would just not be for it. So, after Jerry and Kat are separate group chats we realized that Jerry cannot take a joke for his life. So, we have to be literal with everything that we say (which is hard because we all are sarcastic). Once again, it wasn't much of a big deal until Jerry says one day (when for some reason he and Kat were in the same chat) \"Hey Kat I like your ass.\" We were all shocked because he was still new and stuff. Of course we all take offense to this because we've known Kat for longer and we thought he was serious. Then my other friend (we'll call Jub) starts trying to defend him until he says \"Jub I like your ass\" and \"I look at Jub and Kat ass.\" Yeah Jerry was kicked soon after. Jub tried to defend him but the rest of us agreed that he went way too far. Now fast forward to the next school year. Kat had left the school so now there's an open spot at our table for 4 (the rest of the group was spread throughout different classes). Jerry decides to take it. Here comes part two. We notice that Jerry tends to stare... In the wrong places. In a group of 80% girls this is a problem. On top of that he doesn't do his work (a problem for a group of people who do their work) and is a constant distraction. He also starts to be VERY annoying. He will constantly try to peek into others conversations, fake a throw or hit to you and swap pencils. All of us start to become very annoyed. Even Jub, who at first defended him wanted to cut him off. I wanted to give him one last chance however. So we kept him. Now here's the final straw. He starts to hangout with this group of boys we call \"roaches.\" They are loud, disrespectful, and just all around annoying. So now, Jerry's attracting the wrong people over here and we're all over it. My two other friends in the class have already cut him off but I'm hesitant to.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I've tried to subtly cut him off but he's too dense to realize the hints.\n(2) He's also recently said things about my girlfriends ass and I didn't like that.\n(3) So, Jerry constantly is around me doing the same stuff.\n(4) Long story short: Am I the Asshole if I cut off a person who is a pervert, constantly being annoying and distracting, and said perveted things about my girlfriend?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Today, I had plans with my boyfriend to get lunch and go swimming. I didn't plan on going with him in the first place, but when I mentioned it last night, he wanted to go too. Well, today, he laid in bed until he had work at 3pm. I spent the night at his place and at noon, I told him I was leaving for lunch soon if he still wanted to come. 30 min later, he hadn't moved and I was leaving. He told me to text him when I was ready to go swimming because he still wanted to do that. Well, I finished lunch and texted him that I was ready to go at around one. After getting no response, I told him I was leaving and he could meet me there. Halfway there, I got a call from him saying that he was gonna stay home because he was worried about being late for work in two hours. (Context: from his house to the pool is about a 15-20 minute walk and he works 5 min away from his house). So I went by myself. He asked if we could get dinner after he got off of work, but then at 7, informed me that he had to go to a meeting and asked me if I could wait. I told him I was hungry so if he wanted me to wait, he had to text me with a DEFINITE ending time for the meeting. (Our dining hall stops letting people in at 8:40pm.) At 8 I went to dinner by myself. No text or anything at all until he called me at 9:30 saying he was getting food from my favorite restaurant and offered to bring me some even though I already ate. Obviously, I accepted, figuring this was his way of apologizing, so I met him at his place and we ate at 10. Well, he talked to me for a few minutes and then went to go play overwatch with his friends. He asked if it was ok first since I usually play with him too, but I didn't have my laptop. Of course I said it was ok, but he played for 2 and a half hours. He is a loud talker, but when he has headphones in he fucking yells so loud. At one point I managed to fall asleep despite the noise and he literally woke me up, said nothing, and went straight back to playing his game. Eventually I told him I was gonna leave because we have class tomorrow, but he made me wait for his match to finish. Then took the longest goodbye.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR My boyfriend blew me off all day for some reasonable and some unreasonable things and I wanna know if I should be upset.\n(2) It wasn't sweet long, it was just him staring at me and standing in front of me so I couldn't leave.\n(3) I wouldn't be upset if he'd just said he was busy or at the very least stopped making plans that he would inevitably cancel last minute.\n(4) I'm getting more and more frustrated and I've mentioned it and he'll apologize, but nothing will change.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Like, /really/ bad.\n(7) I know I need to change, but I don’t want to.\n(8) All I got in response was a shrug, a nod, and no change.\n(9) Am I an asshole for taking advantage of what’s basically a free wine subscription?\n(10) I’m a creature of habit; if they keep buying me booze, I’m gonna keep drinking it.\n\nThe reordered list is:\n<task1>(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5)-(6)-(7)-(8)-(9)-(10)<task1/>\n\n**Task 2**\nUse your answer for step#1 as a source sequence.

I was not laid off, but it was made pretty clear that there was not going to be room to grow there so I started looking for a new job. Got a new offer within a month at a place about 45 minutes - 1 hour away for $25k more than I was making. During rush hour my commute was about 1h15m - 1h30m. I'd leave around 7am and get home around 6:30pm. &amp;#x200B; Our lease was ending in three months, and we had been planning on moving out already. I suggested moving somewhere in-between where we work and let her choose the place. So she found a place she thought she liked and we ended up moving there. It's about a 30 minute commute to work for me, and a 30-40 minute commute to work for her depending on traffic. &amp;#x200B; Now, for the hobby. She's part of a non-profit organization from our college that creates cat sanctuaries. She takes care of two cats that live outside her house from junior year. It's about 10 minutes from her work, but it's in the opposite direction. Her commute home, including feeding the cats (as in parking, going to the sanctuary and feeding the cats), is about 1h15m. &amp;#x200B; She hates it, understandably, because having a 1h15m commute sucks balls. But it's a hobby, there's other people in the organization that can help feed the cats, but she's adamant that she has to be the one to do it. She wants me to look for a new job so that we can move back to where we used to live. &amp;#x200B; In the first month, I said yeah we can do that once our lease is up, but I've actually grown to like my new job a lot. I'm a respected member of the team, the workload is pretty heavy but manageable, my boss is a great guy, and the money is good. I even got a 5k raise in my yearly review. I said we can try to move 15 minutes closer, but she says that's barely going to make a difference and we have to move all the way back. &amp;#x200B; I just think that's ridiculous. I get that she loves these cats, but I don't think she needs to be the one to feed them every day. I think it would be absolutely absurd to leave my job just so that she can be closer to the cats. She complains about it constantly and we keep getting in fights because I tell her she should just let someone else feed them during the week and that I wouldn't move anywhere that my commute would be longer than 45 minutes. &amp;#x200B; My latest suggestion has been that we wait for our lease to end and try to see if we can switch to monthly payments with no lease, then if I can find a new job that seems good we can move. She's not happy with that and wants to move as soon as the lease is up. We ended up getting into a fight about it where I said that living somewhere that our commutes to work are similar is more important than living close to her cats. &amp;#x200B; I get that it's important to her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) &amp;#x200B;\n(2) Hell, I even used to drive her there every weekend before she got a car, and helped pay for the food before she started taking food donations.\n(3) I actually think it's amazing what she does and how committed she is to them, but I just think it's ridiculous to base decisions about my career around these cats.\n(4) So, am I the asshole?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

So ever since I started my period it has been incredibly irregular (I can go up to 5 months without one). This has been going on for a couple of years now and I contemplated getting out on the pill to try and regulate it but then I saw the side effects and was immediately put off. I did some googling and found this disorder that seemed to fit perfectly with my symptoms. I assumed that I had it for about a year before actually getting tested for it and being told that I didn't have it (this was back in September before I was dating this person). Fast forward to the present day and I've been in a relationship for just over four months now. We had a discussion about contraceptives and my s/o asked if I was on the pill. I said no and that I didn't want to be on it because of the side effects. They said they were okay to use condoms but would have preferred that I was on the pill as they really didn't want a child. I felt bad about the whole thing and stupidly decided to tell them that I had this disorder.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) In one sense I do have the main symptom that calls for a diagnosis of the disorder which is irregular periods but I didn't have issues with my ovaries visible via the ultrasound I had.\n(2) Considering all of this, AITA?\n(3) They were very supportive and said that it was completely fine that I didn't want to use contraception because it was already unlikely that I would get pregnant naturally.\n(4) So technically I am less fertile than most but I don't have the disorder that I told my s/o that I had.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

So I've been living in a 3 bedroom apartment with only 1 other roommate (both of us 23M) and when we moved in I got the \"master\" bedroom which was downstairs and he got one of the 2 smaller bedrooms upstairs. The master bedroom is only bigger by about a dozen or so square feet, so nothing dramatic. The only thing that really sets it apart is its downstairs away from the main living space and away from the 3rd empty room. He also has a girlfriend who lives with us rent free for the moment and she sleeps in his room with him. Now we have added a 3rd roommate (21F) who will be moving in soon and she will get the room next to his.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I'm obviously opposed to this and argued back that I should get the room because I originally found the place and took care of all the paperwork and general tasks to secure it, and I'm the one who pays the bills for the place (he still pays me for his half of the rent though, I just actually write and send out the checks).\n(2) They argue that since a new person is across from them their privacy will be interrupted and that since theres 2 of them they should get the bigger room.\n(3) But now he and his girlfriend have essentially demanded that we switch rooms so they get the master bedroom.\n(4) So yea again, nothing too serious but would like input regardless.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Two of the people in the group chat used to be friends but stopped being friends after he got roasted in the group chat. Let’s call them friend 1 and friend 2. So some background friend 1 has a tendency to joke around with us not taking too much seriously and friend 2 takes things very seriously to a point that we can’t joke around with him that much without him getting triggered. The 2 other friends and I decided that we were not gonna make any jokes at his expense but friend 1 decided not to do that. He knows that friend 2 gets triggered very easily so he goes in on a tirade of making jokes at his expense. Tbh the jokes were pretty dumb but as we predicted friend 2 got really triggered to the point of leaving the group chat and blocking friend 1 on every social media. So a couple of weeks go by and me and friend 1 are sitting at a fast food place eating. I get up to go to the bathroom and leave my phone on the table. Friend 1 decides to grab my phone and call friend 2 to try to mess with him some more. (Me and friend 2 are still friends at this point.) I come back from the bathroom and friend 1 tells me what he did. I start to get a parade of texts from friend 2 insulting me and calling me irresponsible and that I have not respect for myself by letting friend 1 use my phone. I tell him that It wasn’t my fault I was in the bathroom but at this point friend 2 was really triggered. He told me that he had enough and that I needed to do something about friend 1. At this point I was also pretty angry with both friend 1 and friend 2 for trying to involve me in their dumb beef. So I told the I’m not picking any sides and both of them needed to deal with their own problems.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He continued insulting me on text so I decided to just block him for the day.\n(2) There’s a lot of history and detail with both of the friend’s beef that would make this post really long... it honestly gets pretty awkward sometimes so I never take either of their sides.\n(3) Friend 1 was fine with that but friend 2 was not.\n(4) So AITA here?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Yesterday i took my boyfriend to class with me and we were going to go to a Museum after for an assignment i had to do. I commute a little over an hour to school- its a train, a bus, and a walk away. Everything was fine until we got off the train and onto the bus. We were making small talk and i mentioned in passing that i might transfer into bioinformatics (im a bio major), and he kinda lost it. This is kinda how he conversation went; Me: “yeah i was thinking about doing bioinformatics! [my school was making it a seperate major next year]” Him: “Thats not a great idea. Youre terrible at math.” Terrible at math? Do you mean that because i ALMOST got a B in precalc junior year of highschool? Him: Yes, i mean come on. You were never EVEN in the middle of the pack [in relevance to people taking math classes] Me: ..do you know how incredibly insulting that is? I got an A at the end of the semester; the final just messed me up but i still got it? Him: it would be an UNNECESSARY stress on you Me: literally every stem major is under unnecessary stress. If i didnt want to be under stress then i wouldnt GO TO COLLEGE. People were staring because he insulted my intelligence so LOUDLY on this PACKED bus. I was so insulted but he just shook it off as if that wasnt the most degrading thing ever. I just walked to class and sat down. I didnt say a word to him after i told him he was being insensitive, i just told him we were no longer going to the museum. Then after class he wanted to go eat something and i brought it up again Me “If you think im not smart enough to be in engineering then we’re done here. I dont want to be with someone who blatantly thinks hes smarter than me because he CAN “handle” engineering” We just sat in silence. He walked off for a bit, but i waited for him because he doesnt know his way around school nor how to get on the right bus or the right train. And then he kept talking. We were at the bus stop and he opened his mouth AGAIN Him: you were just never exceptionally good at math. You havent even taken calc yet! Me: you shouldnt me talking because youre NOT even in college yet Him: i dont think you could handle a college level math class. Do you want me to lie? Midterms are hard Me: (im tearing up at this point because when i get super mad i cry and he was being extremely rude) And what MIDTERMS have YOU taken? Youve literally never stepped inside your own college MATH class. Who are you to tell me what i CAN and CANT do?! You would never say anything like this to [ insert girl friends we have that are in engineering] Him: yeah well thats because they were in my calc bc class and theyre actually smart too Me: (i couldnt stop tearing up anymore) So just because you took calc bc in highschool means that youre smarter than me and that I WONT be able to handle a bioinformatics major. Youre so RIGHT! (/s) Seriously, stop talking. We get on the bus and the idiot KEEPS TALKING. I ignore it We get to the train station and i walk off to go charge my phone and he follows me Him: Listen, you dont even LIKE math. And you were never that great in Ap stats or physics Me: you mean MY FAVORITE CLASSES? the classes i got As in consistently? The easiest AP classes ive ever been in? Who are you to tell me what i LIKE and DONT LIKE?? If i didnt like physics why would i take BOTH ap physics 1 and 2 ? Stop talking He kept trying to hammer in his point and kept trying to tell me why i wouldnt be capable in engineering and that is super offensive because im not BAD AT MATH. Sure, hes good at math. But that doesnt mean i couldnt handle it. I was literally crying all day and he just kept talking. He says that im twisting what he said, that he didnt mean to say it the way he did, that he was just being honest, and that i heard him wrong. Those are all of his excuses and they ALL contradict each other. He didnt stop when he saw me crying at the bus stop. On the bus. At the train station. Nor on the train. He apologized Twice.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Reddit, what do you think?\n(2) Im still mad.\n(3) Once at the very end and once when j dropped him off.\n(4) They were not sincere because later he kept texting me that he was just “trying to explain” when i literally NEVER ASKED FOR HIS OPINION IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

He had been emotionally manipulating/controlling me for around 7 months which was turning me against my own family, my friends and acquaintances alike. It was basic stuff to begin with like playing my emotions and belittling me, eventually escalating to him basically keeping me confined to my room. Most of my stresses started over the summer as it came out that I suffer from pretty extreme anxiety and had up until that point been majorly unaware of it. I'd had a stable life up until last summer when I was preparing to move to university 200 miles away from home. This was a huge deal to me and my ex was acting really off about it which stressed me out a lot. After I moved into my flat and started the term, he initially didn't give two shits until my best mate at the time forced me into doing some pretty fucked up stuff that I didn't want to do (using threats). After I told my bf, he got mad at me over it and come the start of this term, started to get mad at me for talking to certain people and was constantly monitoring my actions via social media, demanding my location.etc. This in turn led to me losing my social life and becoming permanently locked in my room out of fear for what he might say if I met a friend. It was also after this he began to suspect he had some serious mental health problems and was genuinely struggling with severe mood swings and was hurting himself/had thoughts of hurting himself. I blamed myself for this as it only really properly manifested after I told him about what had happened. It eventually resulted in him calling me to tell me he was going to drown himself in the river on my hometown. I was terrified and started worrying the house down in panic.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I promised him I'd always look after him and help him through the issues but recently my eyes were opened to him doing some fucked up stuff like, going through my phone when he came to stay and sending screenshots of private conversations to himself without me knowing (he kept them in a folder on his pc and sent them to others), having a go at me for talking to my family and for telling them the nasty stuff he said and how he'd isolated me from everyone here.\n(2) I still care about him and want to support him through getting help but I don't want to speak to him anymore because he keeps trying to manipulate me back into being with him again and he's angry at me for my choice so I feel like an asshole for both leaving him and for choosing to not support him when getting help for his mental health.\n(3) At this point I was so pissed I left him but I've heard that he's been struggling again recently and has/has considered seriously hurting himself after the breakup.\n(4) I had spoken to him on many occasions about his behaviour and kept forgiving him over and over but the stuff mentioned was the final straw.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

They said it was either gonna be friday or saturday. That was all info given to us at the time. Since I didn't hear more of it I assumed it would be on saturday (bad planning on my part I know) and so I was gonna spend the friday after work at my gf. On wednesday I get told I can end work at 1 pm on friday (this never happens) so I tell the gf I can come over at 2 instead. Last night when me, Kodo and Mr T were in discord Kodo suddenly says we're going out on friday at 3 pm (that means somehow he and Solo's gf forgot I always end work at 4 pm) and that Mr T apparently hadn't been invited. Also we're going bowling at 8 pm. I get pissed at Kodo for not telling us sooner and forgetting to invite Boba Fett's oldest friend, meaning I gotta tell gf I'll come over at 9 pm instead. Mr T get's pissed aswell having not been invited.

I am still in high school, although it's homeschooling. I tell my manager I can't work Sundays and Thursdays. A few weeks ago I told him I can't work Tuesday/Wednesday (I allowed him to request which day due to my semi flexible schedule.) He chose Tuesday to have off. This week I look at the schedule (which changes every week, for some reason) and find that I am working both Tuesday AND Wednesday and only those 2 days. I text my manager and tell him early on Monday afternoon, right after I saw the schedule, that I can't come in on Tuesdays because that's a school day for me. He asks me to come in \"just for this week\" but I told him no. One, because I know if I say yes he will put me on the schedule for more than this week, that's how he is. Two, my school schedule is not flexible right now. I'm about to graduate and have lots of coding classes that I'm studying for and cannot afford to sacrifice time I set aside to reach my goals. It's important to note that I have school through summer, with small breaks in between. I know it would be much to ask to have many days off as he's used to having people on summer break, but there were at least 3 other employees out of school. All throughout summer he didn't cooperate with my schedule, having me work 4-5 days a week with ILLEGAL (somehow unknown to him) HOURS. Based on his track record of not trying to cooperate with my previous schedule, I don't really want to sacrifice more time than I have to to this job like I did during summer. It was a nightmare trying to balance school, family affairs and work, among other things.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I don't know if that's important to mention.\n(2) TL,DR: My manager puts me on days I requested off.\n(3) He cut my days last week without telling me and I never would've known had I not double checked when stopping by.\n(4) Kinda feel bad for calling out.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

A few weeks ago I told him I can't work Tuesday/Wednesday (I allowed him to request which day due to my semi flexible schedule.) He chose Tuesday to have off. This week I look at the schedule (which changes every week, for some reason) and find that I am working both Tuesday AND Wednesday and only those 2 days. I text my manager and tell him early on Monday afternoon, right after I saw the schedule, that I can't come in on Tuesdays because that's a school day for me. He asks me to come in \"just for this week\" but I told him no. One, because I know if I say yes he will put me on the schedule for more than this week, that's how he is. Two, my school schedule is not flexible right now. I'm about to graduate and have lots of coding classes that I'm studying for and cannot afford to sacrifice time I set aside to reach my goals. It's important to note that I have school through summer, with small breaks in between. I know it would be much to ask to have many days off as he's used to having people on summer break, but there were at least 3 other employees out of school. All throughout summer he didn't cooperate with my schedule, having me work 4-5 days a week with ILLEGAL (somehow unknown to him) HOURS. Based on his track record of not trying to cooperate with my previous schedule, I don't really want to sacrifice more time than I have to to this job like I did during summer.

He doesn't have a job even though he says he's looking, I can't verify anything because I'm out working 10+ hour shifts. Our relationship has been straining for the past couple of years because of it, cause I'm getting tired of being the only one putting bread on the table while he sits at home playing games all day (or that's what it feels like to me). I've been trying to save money to pay off credit card debt and just to have a nest egg, and I don't make all that much money. He's a good guy who treats me well and never really asks for anything more when it comes to holidays and birthdays, but he does ask for a lot of small things like new games that are coming out or funko pops or whatever and I usually get them for him. His birthday is next month and he's been asking for a new $2000\\~ range gaming rig.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I feel like he needs to get a job so he can pay for this himself because I don't want to feel like I'm raising a kid instead of being part of a relationship.\n(2) Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend that much money on my boyfriend on his birthday?\n(3) I feel awful, but don't feel like giving him a gift that expensive when for my birthday I got a couple of books that I reminded him I wanted two days prior, and socks.\n(4) I feel like an asshole because I've hit him with the old \"we'll see give, me some time\", but with the date approaching, I feel more and more resentful and I don't even want to get him the small things he asks for every now and again.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Sorry in advance for all the words and format (I'm a mobile user degenerate) Anyways to preface my situation I have to give context in the form of explaining my past relationships. All have but one involved cheating, physical, emotional, and mental abuse, and fear of anything romantic or sexual (I don't want to get into too much detail as I'm currently battling severe depression and anxiety). The one relationship that didn't leave me damaged however was when I dated my current boyfriend who we'll call E. Back then I was teenager who had unfortunately fell into romanticizing suicide and constantly made E sad when I told him I would kill myself or he'd leave me eventually. The whole thing was a shit show that I constantly look back on and never forget nor never forgave myself for doing to someone who was like me, someone who wanted to be in a healthy loving nontoxic relationship. I realized, unfortunately after a year of being with him at the time, how fucked up I was and apologised and broke up with E. In my head I was saving E from any more pain I would've caused from my selfish destructive words and ideals though to others it was because he was moving to a different part in the state I live in. After he left, the string of manipulative and painful attempts of romantic endeavors came and went alongside a suicide attempt that, as messed up and cringy as it sounds, was rebirth I needed to change drastically. I love life now though I make jokes about killing myself from time to time but it's all part of my twisted humor. Cut to a year and months later my ex comes back and my best friend sets us all up to hangout at her place. We all catch up and spill a lot of history about what happened when E left. E explains that he got into a relationship with a girl months after he moved and lost his virginity to her only to find out that that she was engaged. I felt sympathetic to the feeling of being used as someone's sexual release toy though I never had sex (when you're a teen with hormones up the ass you're bound to make mistakes in that regard but there's a different reason as to why I remain a virgin which I'll get to). We all exchanged numbers just in case we wanted to hangout again and soon enough E and I get to talking. We text for a couple days and one thing led to another and E asks if we could get back together. I has extremely hesitant to the idea which I told him about and heavily insisted if he was sure. Even though I was no longer toxic I wasn't the same person especially considering the fact that I came out as transgender. I pressed that considering our pasts we would have to go slow and that if I say things that are similar to the crap I said when I was young or that made him feel like crap or sad, make sure to stop and change the subject. Cue to the current dilemma, we're 3 months into the relationship and I'm hanging at his house where out of nowhere I kiss E for the first time. That's not where the issue is however. We go in for more and in the heat of the moment I start teasing the shit out of him by grinding. He loses control for a bit and pins me down on his bed in the ye old missionary style. I freak out getting a flashback to when my ex before him did it and I damn near kick him in the balls. I was apologising so much but he said it was his fault for going too fast. It made it worse when deep down I wanted to go further but my extreme fear and cowardice made me pussy out. We talked it out and we just went about playing videogames. After that day the same thing happened for 3 more times minus the almost assault via my foot to his testicles. We'd hang, thing's get steamy, I tease, I freakout when he returns it. He's started to get frustrated for this double standard which I've apologized for countless times. I've been trying so hard but my past just comes to haunt me and I end up feeling like a whore when I want to go further.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I'm sorry if this post is all over the place but it's midnight and I'm suffering from the flu and depression so my mind is not exactly in the right as of now.\n(2) **TL;DR Ex who I made sad with teenage angst gets back together with me.\n(3) So Reddit, AITA?\n(4) 3 months in I sexually tease the shit out of him but when he tries to return it I pussy out multiple times **\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

His parents were missionaries and they dragged him along with them. He had been depressed before moving but it has gotten so much worse after. He found out he wouldnt be coming back until at least 2021, This led to me(16) and a few of my friends(all 16) to talk to him in a groupchat everyday for almost 4 months. We saw him slowly spiral down and down until the point where he stopped caring if he lived or not. But recently it's become a burden for me to keep talking about the same three topics of why he is depressed, and all it does is lead to me being sad, and him getting a moment of bliss.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If you have any questions you can ask.\n(2) I've slowly started pulling away and been only on to talk every 3 or 4 days.\n(3) I may not answer right away but I will.\n(4) I've done this for nearly a year and 3 months now and I find it extremely hard to find the will to message him everyday knowing it will lead to me being sad and nothing changing within him.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

There's an auto body shop roughly 3/4 mile from my work site, which is convenient as it's semi-close, however it's not reasonable to walk between there and my work site due to time constraints of a busy workday. The auto shop offers a shuttle service in one direction- from the shop to my work site. So once my brake job was complete, I would require transport from my work site to the auto shop. Normally, I'd do Uber. But my partner happened to have an off-day from work on the day that I was planning to get the auto work done, and he lives close to both my work site and the auto shop (we've been together 2+ years but do not yet live together). So my thinking was- when my car is ready, he can pick me up at work and drop me off at the auto shop. I notified him about 1 day in advance of this plan. He grunted some comment about not liking to have to do extra stuff on his day off, but he agreed. On the repair day, around 1pm I get word from the auto body that my car is ready. I call my partner to tell him to come get me. When he answered the phone, it was clear that I'd woken him from sleep. So I feel bad, but I told him \"look, the place is open till 5pm. Just finish your nap and then come pick me up once you're actually awake\". But no, he wanted to come do the drop at that moment, to get it over with. So he picked me up and then dropped me off at my car no problem. When he dropped me off at the auto shop, he told me he was going home to go back to bed. That evening he called me when he was awake. In conversation, he tells me it *really* messed up his day off to have to transport me to my car. He asserted that - as a floor nurse, he **needs** his days off for catching up on rest. I thought about it, and quickly stated that I didn't feel bad whatsoever; I've transported him to appointments in the past on my days off from work, and of course I would expect him to do the same for me. Then he gets more upset, claiming that I'm inconsiderate of his time off and his well-being. He even goes as far as telling me that I \"need to bring \\[him\\] dinner\" for the inconvenience that I caused him (I would have been fine to pick up some take-out for him in any case, but his sense of entitlement seemed undeserved and particularly annoyed me). I'm a bit floored by all this.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If this latter part is true, then maybe I should feel badly for assigning him this task on his day off.\n(2) He often (not just in this instance) talks about how on his days off, he just really needs to rest and recharge, claiming that' it's a nurse thing' that I wouldn't be able to understand.\n(3) I do have many concerns about how this behavior will affect our relationship when we live together, but before I even start thinking along those lines I first need to know - AITA?\n(4) In any serious relationship (we've been together 2+ years), I would expect any partner to accommodate such a simple request without making some big deal out of it.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

We're both first years, so we don't have as much experience with campus life as as the average student. The position is one that basically involves J representing our faculty's voice (social sciences and humanities) at the student alliance level. For some reason, there are four positions for this yet only two people ran. I see J winning anyways as she is running uncontested. She won't stop talking about this election (signed me up to promote it for her without asking me, even forged my signature, constantly messaging me to post her promo stuff on social media). I'm worried I'm being an unsupportive asshole because I have been calling J out for her lack of campus life awareness. She doesn't know anything about basic issues pressing students. She didn't know about our student newspaper, our radio station that's shutting down, a referendum taking place during elections regarding bus passes, or a vigil for the Christchurch shooting that happened today. I feel she's simply running because it's an easy win for her, she has a lot of connections and it'll look good on a resume.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Sometimes I think I'm not the most empathetic person, is this the case here?\n(2) I feel I'm being insensitive and should support her no matter what as a friend.\n(3) She has a massive following compared to me anyways and so I thought the difference was negligible.\n(4) Also I agreed to post her flyers on my socials but I went into settings so she's the only viewer of my stories.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Including myself. Since we're in UK, we can legally start drinking at age 18. My younger brother (20M) started at age 17 and spent the first two years of university really going hard at the drinking culture. When we would drive down to pick him up from university once every few weeks, he'd be really hungover, every single time - like a lifeless zombie. He drank pretty much every day, including day drinking pints of beer too. At the start of his 3rd year last September, he made the decision to completely quit drinking alcohol forever. He said he had enough of the hangovers and blackouts. Initially none of us in the family took him seriously, neither did his friends, but the weeks rolled by and we realized he was serious... Now it has been 6 months since he last drank, and I honestly think my family feels threatened...all of them keep trying to pressure him into having a drink, but he doesn't budge.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) After I had a heart to heart with him, he told me his drinking was really bad, and that his hangovers would last days even.\n(2) I then told him that I'm incredibly proud of him, and that he's inspired me to stop drinking too (1 week sober so far).\n(3) So my dad asks my why my brother hasn't drank and how he needs to \"lighten up\", I tell my dad that what my brother did is an incredibly brave thing to do at his age, and my dad tells me to shut up and calls me an asshole....he goes on to say that \"You're discrediting real brave people like soldiers and firemen when you use words like bravery so casually\".\n(4) My mum agreed him with too....I'm lost for words\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Also, he's now 19 and I'm 17 (I know we're pretty young but yeah) I and my ex met through a video game during the new year 2017. We started to chat a bit and he soon invited me to his discord chat. I made new friends there (I'm still friends with those friends though) and we were getting along well. A year and a half passed and during that time we were in touch actively. He was dating someone at the moment and I was a bit jealous to be honest, even though we had never met. I knew what he looked like and I knew where he lived, we snapped each other occasionally, and face timed each other a few times. We started dating in May 2018. The first month was like I was wearing heart-shaped glasses, but in the back of my mind, I kind of knew it wasn't gonna work. I knew we had it coming at some point and I was correct. He started to seem distant and absent and didn't treat me with such tenderness as he used to. I didn't mind it that much as I thought he's probably busy with school work. And one day I woke up and saw a few new messages. They were from him. He said he's not feeling us anymore and asked if we can just be close friends. I was a bit shocked at first but accepted it quickly. To be honest, I really always knew we weren't gonna work. He told me that he will still be there for me since he knew I was going through a hard time. (I have been having mental health issues since early 2017, but at the time I was doing the worst I had been doing so far). At first, it was okay, I was doing well and I didn't put my mind into it but then he started to tell in discord about a girl he met in college. He told me she was the cutest ever and everything. I encouraged him to talk to her but at the same time, I felt so weird having him talk about a new girl literally like six days after he broke up with me. Even if I knew we weren't going to work, I felt like some kind of a worn-out toy that had just been replaced. I knew he develops feelings fast but I was still starting to question our relationship even more. Was it all ever serious for him? It was for me since I rarely like someone who likes me back and he was one of them, and now it seemed like he didn't like me that much after all. I felt pretty betrayed, but I kept going for him since he didn't realize that I was doing badly and I didn't want to ruin his joy. I mean he got new friends in college, apparently, a new girlfriend (after 2 weeks breaking up with me) and I didn't want to ruin take the joy from him by whining. However, the next thing I realized is that he didn't talk to me anymore. I tried to talk to him because I felt like he didn't want to be my friend anymore and I felt like we were drifting apart. He never answered my messages so I gave up. Even if I didn't want to lose him, I was tired of trying to keep in touch with someone who didn't talk to me anymore. I was still in the chat but it was exhausting. You see, I was going through the hardest time with my mental health issues (That were the most severe atm) and I was trying to deal with the breakup. I tried to navigate my feelings on something else, I worked out and drew and it did help not gonna lie. However, at some point, I couldn't take it anymore. Seeing him talking only and every day about her new girlfriend. Like honestly, all the time. We hadn't shared a word for weeks at this point, and I was about to lose my mind not knowing what to do. While trying to focus on y studies and having this all in my mind, I was having a hard time. Like probably hardest than I can remember. I made the decision to leave him for good. I uninstalled discord, unfollowed him anywhere I could, and made sure I didn't have to see him anymore. I only talk to the friends I made in discord. He didn't seem to care since I didn't hear from him for 5 months. ALRIGHT now to the real deal. I received a message from him last night. He said he misses me and wants to be friends with me again. I said that even if I have forgiven him, I'm emotionally unable to be in touch with him anymore. I explained that even if he doesn't understand what he did wrong, I know that I don't hold any grudges and he doesn't have to be mad at himself but I cannot be friends with him anymore.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) It took me long not to think about him every day, 24/7 and now that I have gone through it, I really want to close that chapter of my life for good.\n(2) I tried to explain that after all that I just can't and he said I'm a selfish bitch.\n(3) He called me selfish for not even trying to be friends with him?\n(4) I personally think no but oh well, you tell me\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

To understand the story you need to know that I'm female and half korean and half german. A friend and I went to a nightclub one weekend. When we went outside to get some fresh air I noticed a group of five people about 10 meters away looking in our direction and very blatantly talking about us. This did not stop for about five minutes and I was uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore this. I just wanted to have fun and did not want to have any kind of confrontation with anybody. I could have walked away, this is true. I didn't because while it was awkward, I didn't want to give up my sitting space. After 5 minutes one guy from this group stood up and walked towards us. Then he said \"hey, sorry for bothering you. But me and my friends have been talking about you for the past minutes trying to find out where you're from. Like, you don't look german. So, where are you from?\" and I replied \"Frankly, it made me umcomfortable that you spent the last five minutes talking about me and looking at me. I'm not a zoo animal.\" He was taken aback and clearly hurt. Without a word he walked back to his friends.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Tell me what you think.\n(2) It made me feel alienated and like I'm different, not like them.\n(3) I'm willing to learn from this.\n(4) Maybe I'm the asshole, but I didn't enjoy getting \"examined\" by them.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

We had been talking for quite a while but realized we lived about 30 minutes away from each other, so we decided to start hanging out in real life. At first, I was happy to have someone outside of the internet that had the same taste in music as myself but the more I got to know her, I started noticing things. To start off about 98% of her friends were online friends. She literally had me and someone else who she actually hung out with in real life and I understood since I’m not exactly a pro at making friends but then it would get ridiculous. We would be having dinner together and these internet friends of hers would be blowing up her phone and she would stop talking to me to message them. In general, she never took her eyes off her screen and if she saw a notification from a group or person she liked she would drop everything and check her phone. To top it all off, because she was basically glued to her Facebook, she would post constantly about EVERYTHING. If her coffee was cold she’d post about it, if she had a headache she’d post, literally everything. One thing she would constantly do would be making these long posts about how much she loves her friends except I noticed she never mentioned me which normally wouldn’t bother me but since she claimed I was one of her closest friends and she was always posting about other friends I was a bit confused. After talking to her family and listening to things she’d share, I found out she had some mental difficulties, I’m talking ADHD, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and many many phobias so I tried to give her a pass, but things just got worse. On top of basically feeling like a babysitter, I then began having to remind her to take her meds and to make sure she ate, showered and did other things. It got to the point where I even offered for her stay at my place for a week over Christmas because apparently, she had issues with the family that was going to be at her place. That was a week I would never get back. I ended sleeping on an air mattress with her in my basement (with a night light and a pile of stuffed animals) since my single bed was too small for her and she was too afraid of the dark to sleep alone in the basement. She barely wanted to do anything with me and spent the week on her phone with these online friends even though I had a million things planned for us to do together. We went to a concert together and we spent two hours before the concert walking around the city looking for these people she had talked to in a group chat because “she wanted to talk to other fans of the group we were seeing” even though I was right there and loved that group and as much as I wanted to leave, I had no idea where I was in the city and was too terrified to get lost by myself. After the concert she told me she would pay me back for the ticket I had bought her since I wanted to make sure we were near each other and we agreed on a deadline for her to pay me back.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR -&gt; AITA for leaving someone who has been depending on me even though I clearly am not that important to them.\n(2) Basically, I realized that even though I had been there for her in real life and had done so much for her, these online friends of hers would always come first and clearly there is no room in her heart for me.\n(3) I told her I didn’t want to be her friend anymore and now I’m being bombarded with messages by all these people including her about how I’m being selfish and that she needs me and that I can’t just abandon someone in her situation.\n(4) Fast forward to now, I have received no money and she has been spending money on gifts (waaaaay above the amount she owes me) for these online friends of hers and on other concerts.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

We’re now seniors in high school and for the past couple of years we’ve been playing video games with his dad we’ll call P (48M). P has always been a hard-ass but that’s his personality and stuff and I understand it. It’s his generation I believe and we still have a lot of fun playing video games together. So recently my friend K, had gotten his (ex) girlfriend pregnant, and this has put a lot of stress on him. We’re still in high school but he’s been missing school very frequently. Now last week, P had decided to punish him for missing school so much. Good, I was completely with P for this. Instead of doing the normal punishment, he is forcing K to play a with him, every time P gets on. So we were playing one day and K said he would rather have his entire PC taken so he could get his homework done and things and P said no this was his punishment. In my eyes, this is P forcing K to play a game with him, using the punishment as the way to do it. I feel like he’s being selfish, forcing K to play this game when he literally said he would rather do school related things. This had made K extremely mad and agitated constantly and obviously no one was having fun except for P. So yesterday I got a text from a girl he’s been talking to that we’re both good friends with, and she told me that he has been very depressed lately and had wanted me to know about it. He said he thought his father saw him as a disappointment and all that, and so I had decided to let P know because I figured he would at least care to let K know he didn’t see K as a disappointment. So today he messaged me back after I had said “Hey, I think you should lay off of K for a little bit. He’s just going back to being depressed apparently. Up to you but our friend said “K like he thinks his dad sees him as a disappointed, and he’s slacking school and he just feels different.” So P said “that’s life dude lol, sometimes you have to do what don’t want to that’s the point, he is being a disappointment” and I see where he’s coming from about that’s life. But I don’t think he’s trying to help K to NOT be a disappointment. He’s always been like this, where he doesn’t really get involved and he thinks he should be alone on this stuff.

So I had a big crush on this girl for over a year, let's call her Maria and him John. One day, after school, me and John were on our way to grab something to eat, when we randomly bumped into Maria and asked her if she wanted to come with us to eat, which she did. Once I was done, I had to leave as I had a Chemistry lesson, while both of them continued eating. (Mind you, I was a senior in High School and I was taking the exams in June). Fast forward to July, I was done with my exams and a female friend of mine told me that there were rumours that Maria and John went out on a date, and the first thing that came to my mind was that day I just mentioned. So I told her that the rumours are false and they never went on a date, they just simply ate for a bit together once I left the store. At the time, my friend knew very well that I had a crush on her and I was so sure that John would never do such a thing and I didn't even give it a second thought. The same friend that told me about the rumour, bumped into Maria one day and Maria asked my friend if she knew about the rumours, which it turned out to be true. So she told me, and then I asked a really close friend, both I's and John's, if he knew anything about the situation, let's call him Ted. So Ted told me that Maria and John had been talking to each other since last December and that they went on a date where they made out. When John told Ted that he had been talking with Maria and was planning a date, Ted told John that he had to tell me, which he did not want to do because ''it would had affected my exams preparation'' so Ted didn't tell me even thought he insisted. When I found out , I was lost. To this day, I really can't believe, that my best friend of 13 years would make out with my biggest crush behind my back without telling me literally nothing. It's not about Maria, fuck Maria I ,now, couldn't care less, its all about honesty and being a decent fucking friend, let alone homie. Some of you may think: '' Oh come on man you would have done the same thing\" and I'll tell you something to show you how much friendship and honesty means to me. One night, I had a girl literally all over me, but she was an ex- girlfriend of a friend of mine, who is a really cool dude but we were far from close friends. So I said fuck it, Im not hooking up with her it's not right, at least according to my morals, so I was trying to kill time while she was all over me, until we left the club. If that was really about not trying to upset me during my preparation then he would have told me after I was done with them, right?\n###List of Sentences\n(1) To this day, he hasn't even said a simple '' I'm sorry''.\n(2) Well he had time but he did not.\n(3) I do not hold any grudges nor hard feelings, I simply don't want to have this kind of people around me.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

We had a talk about this months ago because when we went to have a few drinks with his friends, one of them said to me “Hey thanks for letting him come out tonight.” I was taken aback, because he’s his own person and there’s never been any question about that.

A customer walked up to me and mentioned that how she heard something about a special deal of some sort (one that wasn't part of my department and that I wasn't aware of). She then pointed at a piece of paper that had some text on it (shopping list perhaps?) and stared at me expectantly. Knowing that she didn't ask a question, the only response I could come up with was \"ok\".\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Her answer was \"I'm gonna speak to your manager (name).\"\n(2) My response to this was \"what would you like?\".\n(3) Then her tone quickly turned aggressive and she started calling me rude, saying that I'm \"the second person who was rude to her\".\n(4) At this point, she found the product that she was looking for, by pure chance alone and I figured that there was nothing more I could do to alleviate the situation, so I casually walked away.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

I was aware he had drugs in the house. I learned after the fact that he also had a gun there, which he is legally not allowed to possess. I called to let him know I was on my way. He got irate and was ranting and cussing at me. I hung up on him and proceeded to show up with cops. Evidently this makes me the asshole? &amp;#x200B; So my ex is psychotic. In the last 8 (of a total 15) months, he has at various times threatened me, my friends, my cats and my infant daughter in an attempt to control/coerce me into giving him information that, to the best of my knowledge, does not even exist. I didn't realize I was going to hit \"Fuck it. Get out of my life.\" until the very moment it happened, and so had not properly prepared. Namely, I had left my cats at his house. Psycho has a lengthy arrest record and a tendency toward aggression and a complete lack of regard for other individuals. In the days following the breakup, our communications went something like: \"I want my cats back.\" \"Fuck you, They want to stay here.\" \"I'm coming to get them.\" \"They won't be here.\" until finally, verbatim, the message I sent was, \"Look. This is how this is going to work. I'm coming to get the cats. I'll call when I'm on my way so that you can have them ready. I'll bring the cops with me if I have to.\" When I was on my way, I called, and he started ranting a bunch of bullshit,\"Fuck you, you're not stepping one foot in my house. Don't even pull in the drive. I'm not giving you shit. You're not taking shit from here.\" So I hung up and called police - non-emergency - to have a cop on-hand in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of an altercation. Yesterday I found out he called my mother after the cops and I had left and lied through his teeth about me. I got pissy, and reiterated my desire to **not** see him in person. He responded by getting super upset because I brought the cops to his house when he had drugs and a gun there. (He's explicitly not allowed to be in possession of a firearm, as he has two gun-related felonies under his belt.) Apparently the existence of police in that situation warranted a response. He failed to factor in that my mother can't stand him, thinks he's a scumbag, and doesn't believe a word he says any other day of the week. (He's firmly convinced she adores him, which I think is mostly a testament to his delusional state of mind.) There's a whole bunch of shit I'm leaving out - the manipulation, the scare-tactics, the invasions of privacy and space and boundaries, not to mention the circumstances surrounding the aforementioned threats on the lives and safety of myself and those I care most for (which is why they were the people he threatened to harm, of course.) But I feel like once I get started, this post is going to steadily devolve into me just going on this long-winded diatribe about my asshole ex, and will thus detract from it's purpose which is to find out, was I actually wrong? Given his history and the fact that I told him I was going to do a thing I then proceeded to do, was I actually the asshole for showing up, police at the ready? There are some people who have a firm, \"You don't call the cops. You don't bring cops to my door.\" mindset.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Am I wrong?\n(2) &amp;#x200B;\n(3) And honestly, I personally have a massive bias against police.\n(4) But they exist for a purpose, and while I don't really think breakup-mediation is typically something they should have to be called-upon for, I also feel like it was the least worst of a bunch of terrible options.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

We are a single income family that can comfortably afford to have one parent stay at home. Our child is the jewel of our lives. Well-behaved, intelligent, considerate; everything we could possibly want. Education is important to me, so I send her to the best private school I can afford, and we have an upper middle class standard of living overall. I am content with having a single child. My spouse drops occasionally makes statements that she wants a second child. Whenever it does come in discussion, I list my arguments in a non-confrontational manner to why this isn't in the best interest of our family. We see how stressed our friends with multiple kids are, how little attention each kid gets in some of the larger families, and how it affects their development. Some of the other families in our daughter's school have discussed no being able to continually afford tuition. I'm in no way judging them, but it makes the point that there is less money to go around per-kid. I have a business background and often apply that scope of logic; I feel like with a second child takes resources from the first, and that will affect not only the children but the parents as well. With one child, we can take turns and give the other rest.

I worry about not being able to afford the best I can for both, yet knowing I reasonably could for one.\n\n(6) But I get frustrated because I feel like this is less about providing the best for our children than it is about having more.\n\n(7) After a lot of soul searching, I figure I'd rather deal with (and am trying to plan for) the added stress and financial strain of a second child than have that her regretting not having a second child.\n\n(8) Even if AITA, I'd be nice to get some outside perspective on finding some peace with the argument and figure out how to not be one.\n\n(9) If we did have a second child, I'd love it and do everything I could to provide it with the best possible life.\n\n<task2>6</task2/>\n\nThe minimum number of swaps required to change the source sequence to (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) is 6.\n\n<task3>12</task3/>\n\nThe answer to the question is \"no\".

They’ve disliked me ever since my wife and I moved out of state several years ago, and we started going to a less conservative church (still Protestant, but it had drums and a guitar, so they didn’t like it). They told us many times that we should go to a real church, and continually questioned our choices on everything. Fast forward to about 5 years ago, and we moved back to my wife’s hometown in Texas. We started going to another church when we moved back (again, less conservative than they would like), and it’s been a point of contention for 5 years because they want their grand daughters to grow up in a “better church.”\n###List of Sentences\n(1) My father in law has been verbally, emotional, and physically abusive towards my mother in law (he’s been arrested once), and emotionally and verbally abusive towards my wife.\n(2) Because of the constant manipulation, judgement, and guilt tripping, we’ve decided to move about 2 hours away to a different state near some of our close friends.\n(3) We aren’t cutting off all contact, but we’re being very careful about how much time we allow them to spend with our kids, and are trying to get out of this situation.\n(4) They try to brainwash our 2 daughters and tell us that the music we listen to is “satanic”, they belittle us and treat us like children for the church we attend and other decisions that we’ve made (I’m more liberal than they’d like and didn’t vote for Trump, I think my mother in law should divorce my father in law because he’s cheated on her more times than he can count, we won’t allow them to watch our kids overnight, etc.).\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

I got everything I wanted as a kid and it showed in my attitude. my mom being a stay at home mom got the worst of it because she was around all the time. Growing older and older however I started to ask for less and less. Because I wanted to feeling of achieving and getting something all by myself. I stopped asking for things at Christmas, my birthday, and holidays. Even though they would still get me things. My mom actually started to complain because she didn't know what I wanted because I never asked for anything. Also growing up I realized I was an introvert. So being in school all day wore me out. By the time I got home I was all socialed out and wanted to be held up in my room and in that presepctive I kept to myself. My mom's attitude towards me changed as I became more and more Independent. Some of her words because harsher and harsher. Then I started to think about how my mom would act during evening. She would constantly be on her computer. I'd try to talk to.her she wouldn't listen because she was playing a game on her computer. Even eating dinner.... She ignored us after we became teenagers, and then became angry at us when we would interrupt her wanting to tell her about out day. She started putting me in stress filled situations like putting me in between my dad and her in an argument and having me be the mediator. After a while of this obvious I acted out and eventually asked to go to a therapist.... She told me therapy is for weak people and then repeated it. Now I'm in my twenties moved out she live at least an hour away. And is still managing to upset me from that distance. Whenever we are in person it's a guilt trip about how she doesn't see me enough. I tried to explain to her what an introvert was and she threw it back in my face. This post would be a book if I wrote everything. Very rarely will she do something nice but then it gets held over my head or twisted.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I've met the love of my life and the only one not happy for me is her.\n(2) Am I an asshole if I just cut all ties with her every though everything she has done for me?\n(3) So.....I decided to ask an internet full of strangers\n(4) When I talked to people that know the situation significant other excluded they give me a foul response like I'm the bad guy.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

His parents are another story. His parents don’t like me, are mean and weird, and only really talk to me when they want me to pick up their younger children or dog sit. His mom has given me passive aggressive compliments and his dad is creepy and rude. They once told him to get out of their house at 21 if he’s going to have a video game in his room. His dad wouldn’t tell him his SSN to get off his phone bill so A could buy his own. His dad told the customer service lady but not his own son. Not my problem, I don’t interact with them much, he’s not too happy with them either. A has gone to boot camp and as such we don’t talk to him except through snail mail. My dad, who was in the same branch of the military, knows someone there who can tell us really tiny tidbits and they’re very few in between. Like “he just did x”, for example. Most people do not get this with their loved one. It’s very lucky and I’m sure some people would pay money to hear what’s going on with their kids or siblings at this time. I’ve been relaying the bits to his mom because we’ve been together so long I feel it’s just something I should do. I had a tentative date of his graduation. I texted her this info. My little brother just finished boot camp last year from the same branch, so I know the drill for it. I told her he’ll graduate this day, the tickets have to be picked up a day early, no exceptions. That night we might be able to take him to dinner. Keyword “might”. And then the rest of the weekend depends on all his stuff being processed and it’s not up to him. His date can change for any amount of reasons, especially if he fails something. I’ve been in an all military family for 20 years now. My dad was an instructor at the boot camp my boyfriend is at now. All my cousins go in. When their parents can’t fly up we’d go since we lived 20 minutes away. Graduation is something I’ve had to sit through a bunch of times, same thing each time. Well despite having my dad been an instructor there for 5 years, history of going for family, and being told it by someone working in that area and actively seeing him every few days, his mom starts in with an attitude. His parents always think they are in the right. They always think they’re better than others and know more. I told her all the info about graduation then she hits me with a “Well I’m going to ask his recruiter to get the CORRECT information”. His recruiter does not know anything about what’s going on. I told her he has no contact with him.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I’m not telling her anything anymore.\n(2) Am I the asshole?\n(3) Should I keep telling her about her son or just let her dangle?\n(4) Her reply: “Well I’d feel better hearing it from someone else other than you.”\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

I recently quit my God awful job as a dishwasher at a chain restaurant. I had only been there for a month, and I was already despising every day I had to be there. In the time I was there, two people had started and immediately quit, and another guy was fired because he just stopped showing up completely. I soon knew why. Management was a mess, and the dishwashers were treated like dirt. I referred a good friend of mine, and even he hated it when he was only a few weeks in. They were profiling him a lot, saying that since hes a big, tall dude, he can do everything without issue. We were both pretty out of shape and being on our feet for so long (without a break mind you) was destroying our bodies. I called in on a Friday telling them that I mentally and physically couldn't do the job anymore. There was no way I'd survive for another 2 weeks, and I sure as hell wouldnt ever work for them again. But they managed to convince the both of us to come in that day, then stuck us in the dish room alone on a packed Friday evening.

I recently quit my God awful job as a dishwasher at a chain restaurant. I had only been there for a month, and I was already despising every day I had to be there. In the time I was there, two people had started and immediately quit, and another guy was fired because he just stopped showing up completely. I soon knew why. Management was a mess, and the dishwashers were treated like dirt. I referred a good friend of mine, and even he hated it when he was only a few weeks in. They were profiling him a lot, saying that since hes a big, tall dude, he can do everything without issue. We were both pretty out of shape and being on our feet for so long (without a break mind you) was destroying our bodies. I called in on a Friday telling them that I mentally and physically couldn't do the job anymore. There was no way I'd survive for another 2 weeks, and I sure as hell wouldnt ever work for them again. But they managed to convince the both of us to come in that day, then stuck us in the dish room alone on a packed Friday evening. Now, we knew how to do our job, but we weren't experts, and you need at least 4 people on the weekends so that things dont get backed up...they knew we were the only ones back there and didnt even give us a heads up. We decided that enough was enough. We had been treated like such shit that day by both the cooks and servers. They constantly told us to do our best but then kept saying we still weren't good enough. So...we walked out. I couldn't bare to work somewhere that continued to zap the life out of me, and make my depression worse than it already was. I'm sure since only one other person was going to work in there that night, so some of the managers would have to join them in order to try and make sure they had enough dishes...I'm still stuck thinking about it now. And I've already been having so much trouble finding another job, that sometimes I wonder if I just should have bottled my issues up and just kept working...\n\n<task2>N<task2/>\n\nTo calculate the minimum number of swaps required to change the source sequence to (1)-(2)-(3)-(4), we can count the number of swaps needed:\n\n1.

The PROBLEM in our house is my younger sister. My sister is 14 and a freshman, and I’m 16 and a senior. It is safe to say that we do not have a good relationship, considering all that is happening. Her friends are trash, smoke weed, vape, drink harder than college kids, and are have just awful personalities. She’s turned in to a nasty kid, and has an awful attitude towards my parents and I. She’s failing classes, skipping school, not doing her homework, taking my clothes, stealing my mother’s makeup, etc. Obviously, some discipline has had to come into play, which has mostly just been taking the form of taking her phone or not allowing her out on weekends, which makes me absolutely livid. Most recent case in point was this past Saturday. Sister currently has her phone taken away, but has her friend’s old phone instead, which I have mentioned to my parents. Parents confronted her about it (not actually taking it because she denies having it) and she assumed I told them about it. So, to retaliate, she tells my parents he has video of my friends chugging wine at a party I attended and that my boyfriend and I have had sex on multiple occasions. a) the “wine bottles” were bottles of fucking sparkling grape juice and b) the boyfriend and I have never had sex for specific reasons which my parents are aware of. At this point she’s blatantly lying in order to get me in trouble and I am absolutely pissed. My parents and I sit down and have a conversation in response (basically reaffirming I didn’t do anything and she’s lying) and they tell me they’ll talk to her about it. I leave to go to breakfast with my boyfriend, pretty satisfied with how everything turned out until she fucking showed up in the SAME restaurant to go get breakfast with her friends. I’m pissed. I was always punished relatively harshly when I acted out (e.g. getting a C on a test and getting my phone taken away for a month in 8th grade), yet she gets to do all this other shit to make me miserable and to try and throw me under the bus and she still gets to go out and have fun with her friends. My parents didn’t even TRY to talk to her. Basically, I want to tell my parents that they need to shape the fuck up because this is bullshit that she isn’t getting punished for anything. My grandmother says it isn’t my place to say anything and that my parents already have a lot on their plate, but this is so fucking frustrating. They don’t do anything to discipline her. Just this morning I told her to take of my sweater and my dad just told me “leave it be.”\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Are you shitting me?\n(2) Fuck no I’m not going to leave it be, that’s my shit!!\n(3) So, WIBTA if I called out my parents for their lack of discipline?\n(4) I really don’t want to insult their parenting skills or anything, but this is too fucking much for me to handle.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

The reason for this is poor communication between my wife and her mother. The bride is the daughter of my MIL's friend and coworker, and the two of them came up with this idea and think it's a great idea. When given the chance to say no, my wife did this thing where all she does is express her reservations without actually saying no. Therefore, my MIL ran with the idea. So by the time I found out about it, it was a done deal as far as the people in the wedding were concerned. This was months ago. Obviously, I could have said no, but it would have required a direct confrontation and cause tension between my wife and her mother. Part of me wanted to say no anyway. The whole situation makes me uncomfortable. I don't know anyone that would want strangers in their wedding, so I'm leery of these people that apparently do. I also feel like we're being taken advantage of. My daughters are essentially performing a modeling gig but receiving no compensation. In fact, we were expected to pay for their dresses (MIL took care of it). Lastly, and most or least importantly depending on whether you ask me or my wife, our alma mater is playing in a football game this weekend that I would only gladly miss for close friends and family. So, while I had plenty of reason to say no and would have been within my rights to do so when I first heard about all of this, I decided on balance, the best thing to do was to keep the peace. After all, it's only an hour on Friday night for the rehearsal and another couple of hours on a Saturday. Not that big of a deal. Cut to this Monday, with the wedding a mere 5 days away, we get an invitation in the mail. Come to find out, the wedding is an hour and a half away. This is going to take away our entire Friday night and all of Saturday afternoon.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) On the other, the poor communication is almost certainly not the bride's fault, and I feel like cancelling would cause her more stress than anyone.\n(2) Had I known this in the first place, I would have shut this whole thing down months ago.\n(3) So, WIBTA if, upon learning this new information, I cancelled the week of the wedding?\n(4) On one hand, it's obviously wrong that we're just finding out about this.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

She's a good person generally but her word is not.. trustworthy. The other day he was with one of our friends and after a bit of alcohol, he pushed himself against her and she defended herself and screamed at him to leave. He was arrested and is possibly facing a lot of charges. We were having a discussion about it today over text and she was getting a bit crazy. She was saying how she wanted to kill him and other things. She says that although there is 0 proof, he should be locked away for the rest of his life and is working with her lawyers to accomplish this. Here's where I fucked up. I said \"I hope that doesn't happen otherwise the world would turn to shit\". Bad choice of words.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I tried explaining this to her but she wouldn't have it.\n(2) So she screams at me and tells me that I'm a terrible person and blocks me, tells all my friends to do the same and most of them have turned against me because they believe that I'm a heartless bastard that encouraged my friend to do it.\n(3) Unless this dude literally says \"Yeah I did it\" then I don't think he should go to prison.\n(4) Of course I want this dude to go to prison but I'm of the opinion that NOBODY should be locked up if there's 0 proof.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

She has a heart of gold and believes in the good in people. I for my part am very cautious with my trust because of bad experiences. She also has this colleague who always helps her, wants her to go to the gym with him because he is very athletic and my gf likes to work out..long story short I have always had a bad feeling about this guy and have often told her so. She on the other hand thinks of him just as a work buddy and tried to calm me by showing me bits of their chats. This didn't exactly calm me, but made my concerns stronger because of the frequency they talk to each other. This week he was sick because of a heart issue and she wanted him to tell her how his test results are as soon as possible because \"she is curious what it could be\". Her reasons for being so faithful in this guy's honesty is on the one hand because he told her he just had gotten out of a bad relationship and doesn't want another girlfriend at the moment and an additional reason is that she doesn't have many friends and wanted to make some new in her new job. When we argumented she said that when I am allowed to have female friends why isn't she allowed to have some guys as friends. I then told her that she knows all of my friends and all of them are in a relationship, I on the other hand have never met her colleague.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) At the end some facts:\n(2) We moved in together a half year ago\n(3) We are together for 4 years\n(4) So I want to know: AITA for wanting her to not have contact with this guy outside of work?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

A little back story: I have been seeing my boyfriend for going on 3 years and we have a beautiful son. The first time I ‘met’ her she made it clear to ignore and avoid me before I was finally introduced to her formally. (We were all casually hanging at a bar she says hi to everyone but skips over me) she pulls him away and continues to ignore me. No big deal. No harm no foul. I didnt even know that was his good friend until after, but I figured she should know I was the person he was seeing and would say hello. Even if I was a newcomer people typically say hello to new people. Throughout our relationship she never really makes an effort to get to know me. She only ever wants to hang out with him at the bar and prefers if it is just him. A few times we have all been hanging out with friends she always manages to pull him away from the group to have these close conversations in which she is very touchy with him. Her close girlfriends have told me that she does that to make sure she is the closest to him. They warned me that she would do this to me as well. 4 of her own close friends have said to me something of a similar nature. I was sure of myself and don’t feel threatened by her in any capacity. She is not a stunning looker and she lives with her mom still. I have never even felt the need to ask my boyfriend if their relationship was ever anything more. As time progresses there are instances of her just... what I am assuming is... trying to put me in my place. She posted a picture of herself kissing my boyfriend on the cheek on her Instagram story. I was pissed. Thats blatantly disrespectful in my eyes. They explained it away and said it was no big deal. Another night we were out, she borrows his jacket to wear because she forgot hers. She is a bigger girl and instead of asking another one of the single guys who are her size she asks my boyfriend who is smaller than she is. I feel insane being upset at this but the demeanor and history makes me look at it in a shady kind of way. Yet another night him and I are standing by the dance floor waiting for a good song, holding hands. She comes up behind us and physically breaks our hands apart so that she can run to the dance floor too. And nearly any time we are out she becomes too touchy with him. Not the normal hugs and such. But talking to him like a girlfriend would. Leaning into him holding on to his chest or shirt. Another time she showed up on his guys trip with his best friend (a trip that I obviously cant go on) and posted a ton of pics of her with my BF. It has just been a series of small petty shit that sneakily insinuates her disrespect for me and my relationship with him. I have told my bf that I feel I should talk to her woman to woman but he knows her better and says its not necessary. I know many opinions are going to focus on my boyfriends role in this and I agree. It has been a point of contention that he just doesn’t see or want to acknowledge that he needs to give it to her straight. Tell her to cut the shit. I don’t believe their friendship will change if she just cuts the shit. Given these things it is difficult to really start a friendship with her. I’m not into the competition thing... For a point of reference I get along with all of his other female friends and have become close with some of them. My boyfriend does NOT reciprocate her actions and is not touchy feely with her at all. Back to the present: We are out for a friends Birthday. She shows late and gives me a half hearted wave after hugs to everyone. Whatever I couldn’t care less. She means nothing in my life. But the rest of the night she pulls my boyfriend away. I cannot even dance or hang out with him unless I go track them down and interrupt them. No exaggeration. Again I blame him as well. We didn’t come have him disappear most of the night with her. The first few times I go up friendly and ask him to dance. She looks annoyed and glares at me and continues to keep talking to him. He seems torn but comes with me anyways. He doesn’t want to be in that uncomfortable situation and it’s understandable. She had made mention in front of me using their friendship as something unbreakable. I feel that she holds their long history over our relationship and he buys into it being that “relationships can come and go, but friends are forever”... The final straw of the same night was when we leave to a new bar and she pulls him away once again to the bar and they are together the entire time we are there. People are asking me where he is and I don’t know until I have to track them down in the crowd or at a bar. I pulled him aside to mention wth was going on and he said he was here with me. Ok cool he sees it. A few minutes later we are socializing and doing whatever you do at the bar and I see them again together at the bar getting a drink. No big deal. It turns into 10 minutes then 20.... she is leaning on him and grabs his head a plants a kiss on his cheek. That pushes my boundary and have had enough of her shady actions that night. I go to them and ask what the hell is going on and what is so important that they are chatting the whole night. (Just her talking about some drama with herself, she is always in the middle of some drama) We (her and I) start yelling at one another and the bouncers say they are going to ask us to leave if we don’t stop. She asks what my problem with her is and I attempt to tell her. She over talks me saying how much she tries with me and how much respect she has had for me. I suggest we talk about all this outside. We go outside and once we are away from the group and my boyfriend, her whole attitude changes. She doesn’t even try to hear anything I want to explain (I was heated but calm enough to not get out of control). She goes for low blows and begins bringing up rough patches in my relationship that I thought were private. She says he tells her everything and asks “ you think he really loves you... no” and “I love when you are threatened by me. I makes me feel so good”. I can’t keep talking to this chick. And leave with my BF. He was on my side but not fully. He kept trying to tell me to give her a chance. He said he won’t choose and I would never ask him to. I had no intentions to start anything on a night we were celebrating someone’s birthday. Am I missing some perspective here? I feel that is is difficult to explain these vibes that I get from her and because no one is in my shoes they think I am over-reacting. Am I the asshole for not “giving this person a chance” in the first place, letting it get to a boiling point and losing it with her? UPDATE: Firstly, what a wild Reddit ride it has been the last day. I have tried to read and respond as much as I can. Being that his career involves working 24 hour shifts we have had 3 days of “space”....I still need more and have planned to stay else where for a while. Your comments have put my feelings into words and I feel somewhat clearer in that aspect. I don’t know how or what will be the next step here but I know it won’t be easy. Thank you all. UPDATE 2: the turmoil has gotten worse and we are looking at an extended “break”. I need to get back to putting myself first so that I can be a strong mother and woman.

They've got a tendency to go a bit quiet when stressed, but this most recent time it was massively abrupt. I was helping set them up with a new job after their old one fell through, then communication in every medium with me and all of our mutual friends just vanished, utterly. It took me a full month to reach anyone who could even let me know that my friend was still alive (I worried a lot about suicide), and even then all I was able to get was \"X is fine, just stressed and probably quiet\". &amp;#x200B; It's been 18 months since then. Zero communication until I had an actual back and forth for a few days while on vacation (one that had been inspired by them). I have, over the course of the last year and a half, mostly just stopped trying to check in. It went from every other day (we used to speak daily) to once a week, to a couple of times a month, to once a month, to an occasional once-every-season \"just checking in\" message, which basically never see responses. I brought back gifts from my trip that I knew they'd like, mentioned to them, and got radio silence. &amp;#x200B; Recently, a mutual friend of ours was able to establish some kind of contact, and is ecstatic about rekindling communication, and even delivered my gift for me. I still get precisely zero communication. Said mutual friend doesn't seem to think X is doing much better than before and is still extremely quiet, but is hoping to pull X into being more social. I find that I'm not tremendously enthused by this. &amp;#x200B; It hurts deeply to get cut out so thoroughly from a close friend's life and even simple communication, and I find it hard to want to throw more energy and worry into what feels like a void.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) On the other hand, I know extremely well how difficult it is for someone who retreats into isolation when extremely stressed/depressed to reach out for even basic communications, and if it's been long enough that it would be awkward, it's that much harder.\n(2) It would mean a lot to me to get some acknowledgement, though, but I suspect that's not going to come.\n(3) Am I the asshole for wanting some kind of reciprocation/apology/acknowledgement of the year+ of the silent treatment, or should I just be happy a friend in a rough situation might be coming back?\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

As in, can't stop coughing up a lung with body wracking coughs long enough to catch a breath, both types of asthma constriction kick in, and mucus glands kick into high gear, filling my lungs with fluid. It's an understatement to say that this is not fun, and something I desperately try to avoid. Boyfriend's closest friends tend to like the ganja when we have a gathering, and also know I'm highly allergic. They have watched me go through this more than once, watched my lips turn blue and debated on if an ambulance needed to be called (I always resist an ambulance call because there's literally nothing they can do besides give me pure O2 and rush me to an ER, where again, not much can be done that I'm already trying to do on my own with inhalers, caffeine, make-shift humidifiers, and an EpiPen in case shit gets that sideways), and yet they still smoke up in the same building as me, and just hope it doesn't carry to where I'm at. They regularly don't even take the effort to open a window or go outside. Boyfriend also likes the ganja on occasion, and usually tries to partake in ways that the smoke won't find it's way to me, though he has in the past partaken inside our apartment in his bathroom either when I was asleep, or at work, and felt this was not an issue because it was contained to his bathroom (which has the A/C control over his tub) and should dissapate before I'd come in contact with it. Recently we all met up for a celebration for my boyfriend, and again they broke out the green, went to a back room, and hot boxed it. I started to notice a small amount of the smell, and asked the host if we could do anything to keep the smoke to the back room, so the front door was opened. Then the partakers came back into the living room, with a cloud of smoke billowing with them, and immediately setting off my allergy. I barely saw the look of horror on my boyfriend's face as I dashed out the front door to collapse in a coughing/wheezing heap out front. Only my boyfriend came out to check on me. Everyone else continued laughing and partying inside while I sat outside fighting to breathe. When I finally could stop coughing and the wheezing minimized enough that I could catch a semi decent breath, I went back inside and collapsed on the couch from adrenaline rush and inhaled steroid shakes. No one said a damn thing to me or even asked if I was ok.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) The party just kept going.\n(2) FYI, we are not in a green legal state.\n(3) I really want to ask him to stop hanging out with them because obviously they neither care about me or respect the fact that my desire to keep breathing trumps their desire to enhance their party night.\n(4) On the way home, I asked my boyfriend to relay to his friends that it's not ok to smoke inside anymore if I'm going to be there, and preferably only partake through edibles or something else that is much less likely to set off my allergy, and he looked horrified that I'd ask that.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

So I have had this school friend for about two years. We met when she first came to the school and I, being the extrovert who likes to befriend introverts (at the time), went up and said hi. I kind of took her under my wing as I had been at that school for much longer. She was great at first. We became so close that we became a package deal. For the first 6 months of our friendship, we were absolutely inseparable and loved each other (platonically) a lot. At that time she was one of my few friends because most of my friends moved away. All the other friends in my life have been popular people who I just kinda hung out with or friends who I didn't have a chance to grow with bc they moved so having someone who actively wanted to hangout with me probably made me blind to some red flags. It wasn't until last year that I finally started seeing it. She has a lot of good tropes but also a few too many bad tropes as well. (I really want to paint her personality here so I don't make her seem like a monster) Some of her more prominent bad tropes are: she is extremely clingy and has gotten in the way of me making some friends, she is extremely sensitive and cries over extremely benign things, she is extremely judgemental over people, is quick to make judgments and is very narrow minded about things, brings up past memories that are distasteful to put you down, won't stop bringing up different things eg: omg you so owe me bc I introduced you to ______, makes it a point that you should do things for her bc she got you into something or did something for you out of the \"kindness of her heart,\" does something for you and says it's her treat but then suddenly expects you to pay her back even though she told you earlier that you didn't, only talks about a few topics over and over again, over does jokes ALL the time eg: wouldn't stop singing the I'm already tracer thing which ruined it for me, makes jokes at the wrong time eg: anytime you say hard, wet, long, thick, deep, big etc, laughs AT you when you make a mistake, no matter how small eg: voice hitches when I sing and suddenly it's the funniest thing in the world (i have told her nicely to stop but she still does it), is the victimising queen eg: I was telling her to stop attacking a person in a group chat of ours and suddenly it became about how shitty her childhood was???, makes excuses thinking it will fix the situation or starts crying to get people to favour her, tells other people your personal details without your consent eg: I was at comic-con and a guy was getting a picture with me and asked her to take the picture and she legit told him that I was gay??? Like who tf does that... (I told her off for that), acts extremely childish and whines A LOT eg: I was at her house the other day and her dad was showing me his work shop and she suddenly got all pissy bc I wasn't showing her attention for like half a minute, doesn't have any aspirations in life and expects to ride off her parents, is rude to her parents, is rude in general, can sometimes act like she owns you, you do what ever she wants to do even if it doesn't make you feel comfortable but as soon as you want her to do one thing that isn't even that hard/scary she backs out bc she isn't up to experiencing anything new (grew up sheltered and spoiled), refuses to do most of her school work, 98% of the things she talks ab is just her \"tea\" against people, every time we meet someone she has to point out all of their bad attributes eg: said guy mentioned earlier with the personal info, she immediately labels him as a pervert bc he liked my cosplay and wanted a photo with me, a lot of her opinions are fake bc the moment I say I disagree with them so we can get a conversation going she immediately sides with me and sure for the most part that would be good but I really enjoy having some friendly banter. Some of her good tropes: is extremely passionate ab the things she loves, has gotten me into a few different things that have changed my life just a little bit, has a similar sense of humour (most of the time) to me, has been with me through my tough times, is always available to hangout, will just sit with you and chill, shares answers to stuff and helps me with my work, is encouraging when I share my stuff with her, always has my back, has helped me vent, knows exactly what I need, similar likes to a lot of things, same music taste that we can talk ab, let's me fangirl to her even though she has no idea what I'm talking ab. Now both of these lists are incomplete and if I thought about it for longer both would expand. The thing is, she isn't a monster. She is very manageable but the problem is, is that if I spend too much time with her at once she starts acting less nice, more judgmental and flat out clingy. Now you're probably thinking that maybe I'm rubbing off on her and I'm probably being horrible and for some part of that, you're right. I was an asshole back when we first me and I was judgemental but I had an experience that led me to stop doing that as much as I could about a year or more ago. But now she does it without any prompt from me or anyone for that matter. Other people have told me (as I'm the only one who is really close friends with her) that she insults a lot of people at school just bc they aren't friends with her and I've observed it too. I love making friends myself, and having many people to talk to and hangout with but I have been flat out told by people that the reason they don't hangout with me at school or don't like hanging out with me in general is because they don't like her vibe. I didn't know what that meant at first but then I finally got explained that they didn't enjoying having someone who is listening to our conversations but not joining in at all and doesn't even sit with us (sits at the table next to us and eavesdrops) that she gives off a vibe of not liking them, and since she's always around me, they can't stand being around me bc of her. This definitely made me mad at first bc of the whole \"how dare you insult my best friend\" sorta thing but I definitely started seeing it more myself and realising what they were saying. Now I need to tell you that she IS NOT a horrible person and I still love hanging out with her and being friends with her but it feels like I'm her parent and she's my bratty child more and more with every passing day. Sure, she is the only person that I can talk to about a lot of things and she saves me from being alone during lunches but I feel like she's bringing more problems in my life than she is bringing in good things. (I just wanted to add that yes, she does literally bribe me to be her friend. Every time I feel like our friendship isn't working, she randomly buys me food and tells me that I'm her only friend, guilt tripping me and also making me seem like a bad person if I drop her bc if I do it would seem like I'm just using her for her money. I have tried to get her to stop spending money on me btw) The biggest conflict I have with this whole situation is that, it's true that I'm the only person that's genuinely close with her in general. Of course she has other friends but she has made it a big point to me that her only best friend. I don't want to hurt her but when (because it will happen, unless she cleans up her act, which is UNLIKELY) I drop her I will. she's a genuinely good person under all of the bad but for me there is too much bad to deal. I hate hurting people but at the same time I need to take care of myself and not just the people around me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) So, people of reddit, I have presented my case and now it's time for you to judge: AITA for wanting to drop my toxic friend?\n(2) TL;DR The whole situation to me is like an addiction.\n(3) But I am the one who got me in the situation so I am responsible.\n(4) For a short amount of time it's good/enjoyable but the substance is doing more damage than good and will continue to worsen if I keep doing it but I'm scared of the withdrawal symptoms if I stop doing it. even though the moments where I do it are great, once I come out of it the whole situation is just harmful and slowly ruining me.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Today we went on an excursion with a private guide (M40s, previously lived in Europe and 20 years experience as a guide). We are in a group of 11 people, and when we got out of the bus our group got separated while officers were asking for passports. Half of the group entered first with the guide and the other half was left behind (me included). We felt really uncomfortable and unsafe, since we felt that it's part of the guide's work to keep the group together. My parents and their friends are non confrontational people, but I felt that I should say something to the guy. Here comes the situation: I went to talk to him (its important to include that we are southern European and I was speaking with him in Spanish, whish isn't my first language nor the guide's). I don't know if I came off as rude but I basically told him that he should have waited for the whole group, because people felt unsafe and it was really non professional. I didn't insult him or anything, I know we southern European tend to be very passionate and when we are mad people can tell, but I didn't insult him or yelled like he did, I just explained to him why I didn't liked what he did. Then he started yelling at me, saying things like how he had to go purchase tickets or else we wouldn't get on time in the boat (he didn't warned beforehand) and then starts saying rude stuff like how I am the \"youngest in the group\" and stuff like that. He didn't apologized, what infuriated me the most was that he went to talk to my boyfriend (as if he needed to apologize to him lol). If he had explained rather than yell, I would be okay with that and everything would have been fine. The thing that is making me question if AITA or not is that everyone in my group turned against me and defended him (including my family and boyfriend, which didn't even heard what I said to the guy before, they weren't there, only heard him yelling), not even my parents stepped in (I know that I am an adult, but I feel if I was in their position I wouldn't let anyone scream to my kids that way). Needless to say that this ruined the trip for me and I just cried alone in the boat since I was so sad and so alone. I felt disrespected as a woman and a costumer. And like I am the \"bad sheep\". I know that this can be attributed to cultural differences, but the guy lives in Europe 8 months each year and is a guide for 20 years!\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He should have known better.\n(2) (English is not my first language either, sorry if there is any spelling mistakes)\n(3) So AITA reddit?\n(4) I can't even write this without crying reddit...\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

It was only a BJ, but he deeply regrets what happened and said he would never do it again. Everyone, including the “new” girl, knew about the exchange. Last night we went to one of our “new” friends houses. We got to know her after the past couple of months and we wanted to have a party. We get there, all four of my friends except me got super drunk, since they, including me, were lightweights. We get into her hot tub and almost immediately they get handsy with each other. Me and my sort of sober friend pulled them apart since we both know it would be a bad idea considering his history. My sorta sober friend then becomes drunk and starts to not care. I’ve sobered up throughout the experience since I had very little alcohol, and don’t like alcohol anyways. After multiple occasions of them sitting on each others laps and getting handsy, and me having to break them up and being called a cockblock, we get out. We start to watch a movie and they are sitting next to each other. I break it up and that’s that. After around 20 minutes I notice they aren’t in the room anymore. I go up to her room and they’re making out on her bed. I break it up, send him downstairs, and told her, “Really?”. I go back downstairs and told him that he’s a fucking idiot since it’s the same thing as last year.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He didn’t say anything and my now drunk friend from the hot tub told me to calm down and told me that I shouldn’t care.\n(2) I go to bed since I was done with the night, and woke up this morning.\n(3) Another detail I should add is that the girl in question thanked me throughout the night for me breaking them up when they got close.\n(4) I’m 90% sure they didn’t do anything else after that, but I just wanted to know, am I the asshole here?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

She’s been drawing for a bit longer than I have, although we’re on just about the same skill level. We both tend to draw a lot in class, especially classes we share together. However, it would always seem teachers would pass by, and they would compliment her and her drawing, suggest art schools, talk about her future and just seem to have a grand old time, but when they see that I’m drawing, I get told to put it away and do my work (although today I had gotten all my work done whilst she didn’t do anything and spent her time drawing and socializing, the teacher said nothing.) I know it probably sounds stupid and petty, but I just feel like I’m being under-appreciated (if that’s what the phrase is idk).\n###List of Sentences\n(1) So, idk, y’all tell me;\n(2) I get praise from family when I show them my work, Yeah, but it’s only when I approach them, and it really seems like they’re only doing it because they feel like they need to, to not hurt my feelings.\n(3) Just as a note: I’ve never acted out or talked to my friend about my feelings, I just feel bad thinking this way.\n(4) AITA for being jealous/upset of my best friends praise and success?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

My father was an alcoholic drunk and my mother doesn't care about me, but my dad's out of the picture now. I was basically raised by my older brother but now he's in college, and I'm at home. As a result of this abuse I'm depressed, anxious, and I hate how I look. I weigh 80 pounds and I'm way too fat, so I don't eat much. Some backstory on this is that in July, some drama happened in our friend group and one of my friends, I'm calling him Jon, ended up accusing me of using my abuse as an excuse and he said I wasn't trying to improve even though I was after Emily ended up crying or something when I started getting self-hating thoughts and left. We fought and he wasn't my friend anymore, and I called Emily saying that Jon called me a selfish attention whore, which he basically did with the way he talked to me. She told me she agreed with him because sometimes I hurt her because I feel bad about myself alot and when she tries to cheer me up I \"accuse\" her of lying. I don't, I just have a problem thinking everybody hates me sometimes, so when she cheers me up its hard to believe because of the abuse I went through. She also said it was basically all my fault that her girlfriend Sarah spent their anniversary talking to me instead of her because I called Sarah saying that I wanted to kill myself and she ended up texting me all day instead of doing whatever they were supposed to do. I told her that my mental health was at stake and she got mad because I \"should of known\" because I accidentally did the same thing before, its not my problem to remember their anniversary. Plus, I've known Sarah longer than she has and thats why I turned to her first instead of my other friends for help. She just didnt understand how Jon made me feel - I felt like he was my abusive father, yelling at me. She didn't even have any sympathy for me, and I told her that, that she couldn't understand how I felt because she wasn't abused as bad as I was (she only got verbal abuse and a few slaps - not as bad as me) and how hurt I was that she didn't have any sympathy. She called me abusive and left, which was really rude and hurtful. I told Sarah about it and she got really mad at ME, which was really hurtful. She stopped talking to me, but I figured I'd let it blow over. A week later I decided to be the bigger person and apologize, and told her how she made me cut myself so she apologized as well. Everything was back to normal except she was acting weird around me, and wouldn't spend as much time with me as before and hung out with Jon alot. Because of my abuse and my anxiety I thought it was because she was secretly gossiping about me to Jon and Sarah because Sarah hadn't talked to me since, and so I got really mad at her and asked her if she hated me alot because I needed the reassurance that she didn't because of my anxiety. One day I told her about how I thought she was talking about me behind her back because I can't help thinking about it due to my abuse, and I thought she'd reassure me again. Instead she got offended and told me it was rude to say that because it meant I didn't trust her as a friend but I explained that due to my abuse, you could put me infront of the worlds most honest person and I still wouldn't trust them. She told me to get a therapist if I can't trust anyone and I told her it was offensive of her to suggest that all I did was sit around and do nothing about my mental health because my depression is so bad that I can't go to school. She told me that she \"tried \\[her\\] best but \\[she\\] can't anymore\" and blocked me and stopped talking to me and since then my other friends have also told me that they don't want to talk about my personal problems anymore even the ones i relied on when I think about suicide so that makes me think that she's gossiping about me. The other day she agreed to give me a second chance after I bumped into her with her friends in the mall and talked to her about it saying how nervous I was and that I admitted I was taking out my frustrations about Sarah ghosting me on her. I cried a bit when I saw her and I told her I was sorry and that she made me cut myself because she left.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) &amp;#x200B;\n(2) I really wanna fix this because this is the last chance I have with her and she honestly helps alot with my problems when we aren't fighting so I need it because everyone else can't help.\n(3) &amp;#x200B;\n(4) She hasn't talked to me since we bumped into each other though and she still blocked me.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

FIL decides it’s the right time to take P out and ask him if he’s making the right choice marrying me EVEN THOUGH HE THOUGHT P WOULD PROPOSE EARLIER. Why would he ask AFTER we were engaged and not in the months leading up to it when he thought it was imminent 2) FIL decided to tell me that he didn’t like Indian food. Ok great my friend. Not a problem. I’m mixed race (Pakistani &amp; White), your White but the fact you don’t like Indian food *literally* does not bother me in any way. Everyone has preferences. BUT, to then go on and tell me it’s because you think Indian people (IM NOT EVEN INDIAN) because they are disgusting unhygienic people and Indian food is tainted by their “dirtyness” INFURIATES me. He then says, I can say that because your not Indian.(wtaf) 3) We were all going to go on a family holiday with P’s family. We all submitted dates that we would/wouldn’t be available. FIL decided to pick a date that only I’m not available. P tells him I’m not available. He says it won’t make a difference if I’m there or not 4) He deletes me on Facebook. Literally went to the effort to click on my profile and unfriend me, when I’m not even a part of his physical life. 5) Baby comes along. Asked him to not smoke if he wanted to hold the baby when we met. Blew his top off about smoking being an unproven risk and all the presents he brought the baby were now contaminated so wash them. 7) I don’t know if this is a “new mother thing”, but FIL never asks about new baby. The rest of his family annoy me with how much they spam me asking about the baby. His dad has never asked once about him. 6) Not really an issue but pissed me off. Announced to him the baby was born. He said oh is his last name Patel, he’s taking his mums name? I JUST DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POINT OF THAT WAS. Anyway, we have a family event and I’ve done my best to avoid him the last couple of years. I just can’t be bothered with it. He makes me feel uncomfortable and brings no value to me life. P goes sees him now and them end of. However, baby is now here. P wants baby to have relationship with FIL. Baby is breastfeeding, so has to be with me for a few more months. I don’t want to go to family event because I think his dad is an ignorant idiot. Also, he literally doesn’t even ask about the baby so it won’t make a difference if he’s there or not. Argument ensues. I don’t want to force baby to have relationship with FIL.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Do I stand my ground and not see him, meaning baby doesn’t see his granddad?\n(2) Do I just suck it up and go?\n(3) pls help internet strangers!\n(4) I don’t want to see him.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

My dad got fired from his longtime time about 3 years ago and my parents divorced last year. He hasn’t gotten a job since and is only making a little side money doing photography. He has never really been good with finances and that became apparent as I got older. He made pretty good money and he should have had built a really nice savings up but instead he has tens of thousands in credit card debt and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times in the past. I remember him always spending his money on random expensive things but still he should have plenty of money. He never bought clothes, drove an old car and he bought their house for 100K about 15 years ago. I honestly have no idea where his money has gone. I found out from my mom last week that he was really struggling and that he is putting his house on the market. He burrowed 2K from my mom and my uncle took out a personal loan to help him out over the past 3-4 months. I was shocked by this because 2 months ago he bought a BRAND-NEW living room set even though his old couch was perfectly fine. How can he burrow money and turn around and buy a living room set? Anyways, I knew that he would eventually ask me for money and today it finally happened. He came over and asked for $1,500 and that he would pay me back this week. He said he doesn’t have enough for his mortgage. I told him that I am not as well off as he thinks I am, which may or may not be true depending on your outlook. I own a business and things have been going really great this year and I have finally been able to save a good amount of money but this is my wife’s and I house fund that we’ve been working hard towards. I also told him I was hit with some unexpected bills (TRUE) and I couldn’t help him right now. He didn’t press me about it which was great. Technically yes, I can loan him money and not be hurting but seeing his spending problem worries me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He made his own bed and he must lie in it.\n(2) The question is though, AITA?\n(3) Two other people have already loaned him money and he took that for granted.\n(4) He's refused to get a job, any job in the past 3 years and spent money he didn't have.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

When my sister and he started dating about 12 years ago he came on a family trip and got in the middle of a fight between my sister and me. After she struck me he put himself between her and me and being teenagers she continued to mock me behind his back. When I reached around him to push her he took my head and shoved me down into the bed I had been leaning on. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; Things had been okay until last year while on a family trip to the Grand Canyon. He and my sister are married and have an infant daughter at this point which makes siteseeing challenging. After seeing a few lookout spots over a couple hours we were all in a van together coming up on another lookout. My father was driving and he gets overly dramatic if he doesn’t get clear instructions on whether to stop so we just told him to stop. Everyone decided to get out except my BIL who said he was going to wait with the baby and shut his eyes. At the time my niece was sleeping so it seemed fine. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; My father and I took the longest to return to the car (30 min). When we got there I could tell that my BIL was in a bad mood but I didn’t know why. I guess the baby had started to cry not long after we left the car so he was left to calm her down by himself. We pile back into the car and get on our way. My mother starts doing this profuse apologizing thing that always gets my dad irritated but she was directing it at my BIL. She was apologizing for stopping at the lookout. Not knowing what had happened I tried to deescalate like I’m used to with my parents. I said “it’s fine, if someone doesn’t want to stop they’ll say they don’t want to stop.” Within seconds my BIL was cussing me out. I tried to explain that I didn’t mean anything by it but he wouldn’t accept it. Admittedly I did end up telling him that he’s been a grouchy jerk the whole time, but I had no malicious intent with the original comment. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to tonight, a year later on another family trip. We’re playing scattegories and he’s 20 points ahead of me and almost everyone else. Some of the answers are BS and I challenge a few regardless of who it is. I had a bad feeling that he was going to get mad because he’s competitive so I made sure to ask if anyone disagreed with my answers if they were a stretch. His answer for “Furniture” that start with F was “fan”, and “things associated with money” that start with H was “heap”. After challenging a few of his answers he freaked out on me again. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B;\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I adore my niece but I can’t stand acting friendly with him after he treats me so poorly.\n(2) So I’m cutting my trip short and leaving in the morning and don’t plan to participate in future trips with him.\n(3) I think I’m done coming on these trips.\n(4) My boyfriend would never treat my sister that way and if he did I would take issue with it.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

My birthday was a couple weeks ago and I was allowed to throw a party for the first time since I was 10. My parents put a 10 person limit on attendees; I thought it was fine since I don't have many friends anyway. However, while inviting my friend, Zafrin, a girl we'll call A heard and thought she had been invited. I didn't want to be rude, so I didn't correct her. I just simply told my parents that an extra person would come and they didn't seem to mind. Some background information, A is the richest girl I know and the most spoiled. Her house is double the size of mine and she buys 2 lunches everyday along with the one she packs. She also loves the fact that she is in higher math class than me despite me not wanting to go higher math class and having the grades to. One memorable quote is when I tried to help her on homework she looked confused on, she told me \"The math is a little too complicated for you, I doubt you'll get any answers right.\" I found out later I was right on most the questions. Despite her spoiled lifestyle, her mom won't let get her a dog for some reason, so when she met my dog, Tank (he is a black lab who is around 6 feet when he stands) she was excited. She immediately started calling him, \"my doggie\" which I was kinda annoyed with but wasn't vocal. I recall making a joke, \"You call him your dog when you pick up his vomit.\" When the other guest arrived we all decided to so bad karaoke ( singing off key to songs we found funny, it's really fun) A wasn't very pleased, she told us that the songs sucked, missing the point of the game. During Mine Diamonds, I realized she had finished her pizza besides her crust. I told her she give it to Tank because if she throws it a way he'll just dig through the trash. At first, she sticks her arm out horizontally making Tank see her. He starts to walk towards her and she then starts walking in circles, making sure he is following. I see this and tell her not to taunt him because he has arthritis and we don't like putting pressure on him for too long. She would do it again until I corrected her, once more and repeat. I thought on the 10th time she understood and stopped taunting him. However within a second she is standing on top of a chair and counting to taunt him. My dog jumps and starts to make yelps in pain. At this point, I was really upset and grabbed the crust from her hands and gave it to Tank. I immediately told her, \"Don't touch my dog and actually listen to me or else you might hurt him.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) So I wanted more opinions.\n(2) Is that really too complicated or is math the only thing you can do.\"\n(3) She forgave me but some people have been calling me an asshole.\n(4) She immediately looked like she was about to cry; I realized I said I was sorry and it just blurted out.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

So now I'm 21 and mystep father got drunk in the middle of the day for some reason and was being a bit of a dick. I don't like confrontations so I went to my bedroom to take a nap so my mother could get home and take control of the situation. An hour or so later he came down banging on my door and shouting from the other side. I asked him what was wrong and he just mumbled something about me being a cunt. So I went upstairs and asked him what was wrong. He just went around in circles about nonsense, he had obviously been drinking more since I went to bed. He became irate and I approached him because I was sick of yelling out to him across the living room. At this point he braced himself against the counter and dared me to \"try it\", I was confused because I had no intention of doing anything of the sort. I tried to explain this to him but he kept screaming in my face and after listening to it for too long I grabbed him by his shirt and told him that he's not my father, and to stop acting like he was. He then tried to pull away from me &amp; when I didn't let go, he turned and shoved me. He was stumbling because he was quite drunk so I tried to get him on the ground to stop him from falling and hitting his head on the counter or table or even falling on one of our dogs. When he was on the ground he started clawing at my eyes &amp; ears, trying to gouge them. At this point I realized he's playing for keeps and I've gotta stop the fight to prevent any permanent damage being done to me. So I punched him once in the ribs and once more square in the face. Being drunk, he felt none of it and continued trying to get his fingers in my eyes. With that, I gave him a really nasty headbutt right on his nose. Blood went everywhere instantly, it was pretty disturbing.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Given that I tried to walk away, deal with it with words &amp; only resorted to actual physical violence when I was at risk of permanent damage, AITA?\n(2) He and I are cool now but my mother is not impressed with either of us.\n(3) He decided when he saw all the blood that he had had enough and stopped fighting with me.\n(4) TL;DR Got into a fist fight with step dad &amp; beat him up pretty bad, feeling bad about having to do it.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

He became irate and I approached him because I was sick of yelling out to him across the living room. At this point he braced himself against the counter and dared me to \"try it\", I was confused because I had no intention of doing anything of the sort. I tried to explain this to him but he kept screaming in my face and after listening to it for too long I grabbed him by his shirt and told him that he's not my father, and to stop acting like he was. He then tried to pull away from me &amp; when I didn't let go, he turned and shoved me. He was stumbling because he was quite drunk so I tried to get him on the ground to stop him from falling and hitting his head on the counter or table or even falling on one of our dogs. When he was on the ground he started clawing at my eyes &amp; ears, trying to gouge them. At this point I realized he's playing for keeps and I've gotta stop the fight to prevent any permanent damage being done to me. So I punched him once in the ribs and once more square in the face. Being drunk, he felt none of it and continued trying to get his fingers in my eyes. With that, I gave him a really nasty headbutt right on his nose. Blood went everywhere instantly, it was pretty disturbing.\n(1) Given that I tried to walk away, deal with it with words &amp; only resorted to actual physical violence when I was at risk of permanent damage, AITA?\n(2) He and I are cool now but my mother is not impressed with either of us.\n(3) He decided when he saw all the blood that he had had enough and stopped fighting with me.\n(4) TL;DR Got into a fist fight with step dad &amp; beat him up pretty bad, feeling bad about having to do it.\n\n<task2>2<task2/>\n\n###Explanation\nThe minimum number of swaps required to change the source sequence to (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) is 0, since the original order is already correct.\n\n<task3>4<task3/>\n\n###Explanation\nThe reordered text is the original text, and the answer to the question is \"yes\".

She then told me her partner was emotionally and a physically abusive to her. she showed me messages he sent, pictures of bruises, very troubling stuff. and I helped her break up with him. he know me enough to know my number and would call me and I would either ignore it or conjure some excuse. they got back together and she started ghosting again. for 4 days, she made no effort to communicate and kept her phone off. Finally she messagged me telling me that she told her boyfriend everything we said in private and that she was cutting me out of her life. To better their relationship then after I got angry, she ignored me only to message me a few days later saying that he read our messages and made her write that. we met in private because she didn't want to leave any cyber trail, and she told me she was going to get a restraining order on him and move back with her family. but he had stolen her money before she left. so I gave her $500 to go to her parents(they live on the other side of the country). However as soon as she leaves, I noticed the camera for work is gone. suddenly she blocked me on everything and my friend tells me that they were still together. I finally caved and told the newspaper what it happen and managed to keep my job, but I had to buy back the camera and it's expensive lenses. so now I'm down $2,000. People keep telling me that she saying I was lying to her and Incredibly controlling and blackmailed her into sexual stuff over her job and when she refused, I got her terminated. Those lies hurt more than anything. I lost several good friends because of this. That was a month ago. a few days ago a strange number kept calling me, I thought it was a robo caller until I noticed that they kept calling a lot more frequent. I answered the phone and it was her. she said she wanted to talk to me in private and I said no and hung up. and that brings us to Friday, I came home to find her in front of my house begging to talk to me. I told her I had nothing to say to her and that I know about all the lies. she tried countering and saying she was sorry and she wants me and her boyfriend in her life. that she knows he's abusive but he cares for her and is trying to get help for his temper. She tried to apologize as I tried to unlock my door. as I'm getting inside, she catches the door and attempts to get into the house and lost it. I started screaming at her to get out. after a bit to collect myself. I told her I'd had enough. I said something like \"you lied to me, stole money and a camera off me. I want you to remember how scared he made you feel the first time he punched you and you deserve it the next time it happens because you're still with him\", I slammed the door. she tried knocking a bit without saying anything and then she left. Haven't heard from her since I shouldn't have said that last part but I'm not going to apologize or say another thing to her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR: friend I work with tells me partner is abusive, lies to get money off me to leave him, steals my work camera, gets back with him, then attempts to come back into my life and I snap and tell her off in the worst way possible.\n(2) She's done so much to me in the past couple of months that that would just open another way for her to continue this cycle.\n(3) I do care for her but I tried to help and she stabbed me in the back.\n(4) She's cut contact with most of her friends, she doesn't talk to her parents and I've told them the basis of what's going on but won't go into detail.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

We had an in office super bowl party complete with drinking and snacks and a massive tv. Im not a huge sports fan but i showed up anyway. I have twelve people under me and most brought a date. Plus my bosses and ppl from other departments. I went stag as im single. Anyway since i dont care for football i spend most of my time hanging out by the makeshift bar and snack stand and an employees wife is with me. We hit it off joking about our lack of football knowledge and just generally joke throughout the night. A couple hours in and we've both had a lot of drinks. \"So you came alone?\" I told her this before early on. \"Yes ma'am.\" \"Not completely alone.\" At this point she forcefully grabs my crotch. I am shocked and sort of have a nervous laugh reaction which might have encouraged her as when i put my hand on her wrist to push her away gently she started \"groping\" me through my pants. At this point the following exchange happens. \"Haha, whaaaat?\" I push her off me in a playfull way. \"Haha sorry.\" She replies \"Nah its okay I just need to go to the bathroom\" I then walk away and dont speak to her the rest of the party. At least until the end and we're all walking out and shes hammered. She calls me over to her as im walking out and kisses my cheek while putting her phone number in my hand. I just say bye i had a nice time and i leave. I have sort of resolved never to speak of this again but im joking with my best friend about it and he says i should tell my subordinate. I dont have any real relationship with my subordinate so it would be awkward.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I also think, maybe if I did text her it wouldn't be such a bad thing?\n(2) Idk im kinda hung over right now.\n(3) What do you guys believe.\n(4) Like maybe they have an open relationship?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

It first started by my step dad (which had been in my life for 2 yrs now) leaving without me knowing why .at the time my mom didn't tell me anything about it, I just got some vague idea by eavesdropping on conversations that they had a pretty bad fight... After that I got send into a mental hospital after my mom found my arms and legs full of cuts. But after that I had another mental breakdown because of my biological father. He died when I was only 6. And that really got into me because my mind just started saying how a bad child I am because I couldn't remember who my dad was, I couldn't even remember how he looks like, or how exactly he died... we got Into a family therapy to talk about it, my mom told the therapist, and me how exactly my father died, she told this story about how he saved us from a bunch of drunk man's and that if it wasn't for him I would've been raped... But the thing is, that's now what actually happened... and, at the time I believed it, even going as far as having memories of it, basically, my mom gave me a memory conformity about a trauma.... Of course I got really paranoid because although I couldn't remember what happend, I searched so munch on the Internet because I remember my babysitter telling me about how my dad was on the news... But after I learned the truth, I also learned another thing my mom didn't told me.... remember earlier how I talked about my step dad? Well the reason they got Into a fight/got a divorce is because he had a child fetish. Not saying he molested or did anything illegal, but he would watch porn with titles like \"daughter banging dad\" \"dad having sex with daughter\" and so on... and I didn't learn from my mom this info no no no... I learned from Joel's (my now new step dad) daugher, which in turn learned from my brother.... Basically she told everyone about it, exept me... And so after learning that, and after a second visit to the hospital, my mom told the truth about my biological dad, and how he was actually killed because he owned people money and he didn't have any... I was really mad by it, not by the fact of who my dad really was, but the fact that she lied to me while on a therapy visit, with emotions and everything.... I started hating her, doubting her, rebelling against her... I wouldn't talk to her, look at her, and even let her touch me... Her exude of not telling me/ drifting me away from the truth was that she wanted to protect me, she wanted to not let the outside world hurt me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) She was scared that I would be more depressed if I learned the truth...\n(2) I tried the best I could not to let my felling tower over the truth.\n(3) if you guys need any questions feel free to ask...\n(4) So my question is, was I in the wrong for being this rude to my mom?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

I live in the top and my neighbors on the bottom. I notice that my neighbors are celebrating the new year and have guests over including a lot of kids. They begin shooting fireworks so I take a look. When I get to the window I notice that the kids are shooting fireworks near my car. To picture my parking situation imagine a rectangle as the building and form an L around the building. The bottom of the L is the side of the building and where I park. The top part of the L is where they park and close to their front door. Not much of a yard to do anything with. So anyway when I look I notice not only are they on my side away from all their vehicles and are shooting fireworks on top of a brick which seems unstable. I go outside and walk down and see the kids over there and the owner of the bottom unit. I walk up to him and just politely ask hey can you guys move away from my car just a little bit closer to the middle of our building and he says “dude just go inside” I got under control. I did NOT say this in a mean way. We’ve only had one other incident. It is that they were putting their trash in my garbage can that I pay for. I never said anything but One day it was to full to put mine in so I took their trash out and sat those bags on the ground.

Context is that we were all preparing the house for a surprise party. My dad is notorious for saying that we should prepare weeks in advance, but he does everything last minute. Plus, he expects everyone else to do the work while he sits down and moves maybe one or two objects. Anyway, my dad was expecting the house to be immaculate. He wanted the doors scrubbed down, baseboards re-painted, windows washed, etc. I was already stressed, because my dad had given me three simultaneous tasks to do, and my mom called me to do yet another task. We can’t say no to our parents. You only say yes sir/ma’am or you get punished. I was annoyed because I had so many jobs to do, and knowing I couldn’t tell my mom I was busy, or that I would get to her task later, I rolled my eyes in frustration. My dad caught me doing it, and he told me if I ever did that again, he would take all his financial support away from me and kick me out. I got intimidated and did what he asked of me. But looking back on it now, I think he was overreacting. We could never show displeasure in our house. We had to smile and nod to whatever they said. Anything outside of that was met with corporal punishment.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA for thinking my dad was overreacting?\n(2) Ever since I rolled my eyes, he makes me stand in plain view when he asks me to do something so he can read my expressions.\n(3) When we grew older, it shifted to threats of taking away support.\n(4) If we were mad, sad, or upset, we had to express it quietly and in private, otherwise, our parents took that as “back talk” and we’d get spanked.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

I’m looking for an objective set of eyes on the situation. Also, sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile. We’ll refer to this person as Sam to keep genders/identities as hidden as possible. So, I’ve had a problem with Sam, but I can’t remove him/her from my life because he/she is my SO’s cousin, and they’ve been close since birth. The story begins here: when my SO and I began our relationship, Sam was jealous that SO was in a relationship and he/she wasn’t, so he/she badmouthed me to my SO all of the time. Sam turned out to be so effective at turning my SO against me that we ended up breaking up for about a year. Then, during junior year prom (I’m a whiny teen, as it turns out), Sam was again jealous because the person that he/she wanted to go with went with someone else, and was in a general bad mood. My SO and I were talking again, and as I tried to make my way over to SO to dance, Sam got in my way over and over so I couldn’t. Then, another person went and danced with my SO. I was upset the rest of the night. However, since then, I’ve reconnected with my SO and we have been dating for a while, and Sam has found him/herself a SO. Thus, I’ve had to spend most of this year of school around Sam+SO. This exposure has lead to nothing but constant roast sessions between myself and Sam; Sam will call me scrawny while I will rip on Sam for the stupid things that he/she says. This all culminates in the study session in the library today. Sam had been laughing at me for something that he/she wouldn’t even tell me about, and I was quite annoyed about it. So, my asshole move reared its head. I took a book about fitness off of the shelf and told Sam that he/she should read through it. Keep in mind, Sam certainly isn’t a fat or anything like that, Sam is just slightly on the larger side. Major dick move, I get it. Then, as I was trying to fall asleep Sam’s SO decides to text me, demonstrating how upset he/she is, lambasting my morals, threatening to kick my ass, and demanding an apology. I apologized for what I said, but the entire conversation was tinged by the impression that Sam’s SO believes that he/she did nothing wrong and I was the criminal, which I couldn’t take.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Sam has no right at all to assume that it’s okay to make fun of my scrawniness, and shouldn’t be surprised when he/she gets a taste of his/her own medicine.\n(2) I believe that if Sam would insult me about my body (being scrawny), Sam should be able to take an insult about his/hers.\n(3) I get it, Sam is probably self-conscious about his/her body, but I just can’t understand how someone could think that my insult was completely unprompted and “over the line”.\n(4) So the question is, am I the only asshole in this situation, are we both, or are we just a bunch of whiny teenagers still trying to figure out life?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

I’m sorry this is so long, I’ll place a tl;dr at the end In year 12 I was apart of a friendship group that was made up of 12 girls. (Haha 12 girls for year 12). We weren’t all that close as we friendship groups that kind of joined together after a lot of people left my high school. In that group, I had 2 girls who I considered my best friends since we were good friends since year 7. At the beginning of year 12 we all got along swimmingly but as we got into the exam period it got more and tenser and a lot of people’s true colors showed up (mine included). So, it all started with a girl I’ll call TL. She was quite pretty and had long gorgeous hair. It was her pride and joy. Me and TL had a weird history of being friends and not being friends. We never quite clicked (despite the both of us going to the same primary school together) and it was the case of when we good we were very, very good and when we were bad we were horrid. And in year 12 we were horrid. I’m not quite sure what had gotten me so heated with TL that day, but we were throwing underhand jabs at each other in legal studies which carried out into recess. At one-point, TL stated that she wanted to be a model, specifically a hair shampoo model which I had bluntly replied: “Don’t you have to be pretty to be a shampoo model?” (I know, that was unnecessary and cruel but I was angry and I saw an opening and took it). A few girls giggled and I threw her a superficial apology and forgot all about it. TL did not. My offhanded jab at her lead her to create a separate messenger group which was dedicated to her listing all my flaws such as that I was fat, my hair was too thin, my skirt was too short, and that people liked me so I could give them notes for the classes I was in (ouch but true). This side messenger group included my two best friends as well. They created events which they didn’t invite me to, and only told me after it was over with excuses like ‘oh we didn’t think you’ll like it.’ I’m sure TL had great pleasure in seeing me attempt to cover up my frustrations about being left out but I never really said much about it. After a few of these exclusions, I spent a lot of time in the library, studying or chatting with the librarians who took me under their wing and helped me find textbooks for my classes. By the end of term 3 and with HSC looming overhead I thought TL had forgotten the whole ordeal but, alas, she had not. She created formal get together for the girls to buy dresses and hired a limo for the girls to go in for formal. All these small things hurt but it didn’t really hurt as my two best friends going along with it and then later pulling me aside one day and unloading everything on me all at once. They showed me screenshots of the secret group chat and the circle jerks of TL and her close friends talking about me. It was a cold and hard reality check. So high school comes and goes, and I get into the university of my dreams and I make a wonderful new group of friends. As time passed, I look back critically at my high school experience and realize I am not faultless (with my mouth I definitely unconsciously ruffled a few feathers) in my exclusion from the group but my best friends, as well as the other girls who were neutral, were not faultless either. I unfriended everyone in that group including my best friends and put my best foot forward. And for a time, I was content with my decision. But then one day a girl who I’ll call FH, used to go to my old high school and I befriended bought up my ex-friends. She told me they told her that they were hurt by my sudden decision to cut them off and that they believed I was taking out my inability to get over high school drama out on them. I told her that I wanted a fresh start. My ex best friends and the other girls were still friends with TL. They still went on outings and had meet-ups with her and her friends. I didn’t want anything to do with that anymore. This back and forth went on for a while before FH told me that all my friends thought I was a bitch who couldn’t get over some petty high school drama. To tell you guys the truth, this drama really fucked me up. I went to therapy for some time and even now with my close uni friends, I struggle to trust everything they say to face value. I’m just waiting for the bomb to drop that they never like me and they befriended me because they felt sorry for me. I was content with my decision to cut them off before but now I’m not sure.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Am I the asshole?\n(2) TL;DR I cut off old high school friends who are still friends with a group of girls who excluded me and talked behind my back for a year.\n(3) I feel like I should have said something or done something else.\n(4) Because I’m beginning to feel like one.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

I’m sorry this is so long, I’ll place a tl;dr at the end In year 12 I was apart of a friendship group that was made up of 12 girls. (Haha 12 girls for year 12). We weren’t all that close as we friendship groups that kind of joined together after a lot of people left my high school. In that group, I had 2 girls who I considered my best friends since we were good friends since year 7. At the beginning of year 12 we all got along swimmingly but as we got into the exam period it got more and tenser and a lot of people’s true colors showed up (mine included). So, it all started with a girl I’ll call TL. She was quite pretty and had long gorgeous hair. It was her pride and joy. Me and TL had a weird history of being friends and not being friends. We never quite clicked (despite the both of us going to the same primary school together) and it was the case of when we good we were very, very good and when we were bad we were horrid. And in year 12 we were horrid. I’m not quite sure what had gotten me so heated with TL that day, but we were throwing underhand jabs at each other in legal studies which carried out into recess. At one-point, TL stated that she wanted to be a model, specifically a hair shampoo model which I had bluntly replied: “Don’t you have to be pretty to be a shampoo model?” (I know, that was unnecessary and cruel but I was angry and I saw an opening and took it). A few girls giggled and I threw her a superficial apology and forgot all about it. TL did not. My offhanded jab at her lead her to create a separate messenger group which was dedicated to her listing all my flaws such as that I was fat, my hair was too thin, my skirt was too short, and that people liked me so I could give them notes for the classes I was in (ouch but true). This side messenger group included my two best friends as well. They created events which they didn’t invite me to, and only told me after it was over with excuses like ‘oh we didn’t think you’ll like it.’ I’m sure TL had great pleasure in seeing me attempt to cover up my frustrations about being left out but I never really said much about it. After a few of these exclusions, I spent a lot of time in the library, studying or chatting with the librarians who took me under their wing and helped me find textbooks for my classes. By the end of term 3 and with HSC looming overhead I thought TL had forgotten the whole ordeal but, alas, she had not. She created formal get together for the girls to buy dresses and hired a limo for the girls to go in for formal. All these small things hurt but it didn’t really hurt as my two best friends going along with it and then later pulling me aside one day and unloading everything on me all at once. They showed me screenshots of the secret group chat and the circle jerks of TL and her close friends talking about me. It was a cold and hard reality check. So high school comes and goes, and I get into the university of my dreams and I make a wonderful new group of friends. As time passed, I look back critically at my high school experience and realize I am not faultless (with my mouth I definitely unconsciously ruffled a few feathers) in my exclusion from the group but my best friends, as well as the other girls who were neutral, were not faultless either. I unfriended everyone in that group including my best friends and put my best foot forward. And for a time, I was content with my decision. But then one day a girl who I’ll call FH, used to go to my old high school and I befriended bought up my ex-friends. She told me they told her that they were hurt by my sudden decision to cut them off and that they believed I was taking out my inability to get over high school drama out on them. I told her that I wanted a fresh start. My ex best friends and the other girls were still friends with TL. They still went on outings and had meet-ups with her and her friends. I didn’t want anything to do with that anymore. This back and forth went on for a while before FH told me that all my friends thought I was a bitch who couldn’t get over some petty high school drama. To tell you guys the truth, this drama really fucked me up. I went to therapy",

I ended up replacing the battery but my mom had bought me a new 2DS already. My friend, who didn’t have any Nintendo game consoles except for the Wii, expressed interest in the old 2DS. I agreed, as at the time we were pretty close, considering each other best friends. Along with the 2DS I gave him some Pokémon games that he’d always expressed interest in. This included: Pearl, White, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Moon. Each of these games roughly cost $40 for me to buy. I cherish each of these but felt that I could do without them since I had either beaten them or had the alternate versions of each copy (For non-Pokémon nerds, most Pokémon games get sold in pairs with the two games virtually the same besides minor differences) Fast forward to earlier this week. I made some meme about one of the Pokémon you can encounter in the games. My friend responded, very confused, and wondered what the heck the Pokémon was. It was a fairly common and recognizable Pokémon creature so I was kinda confused. I grew suspicious and hated asking him so, but questioned him in a joking manner “Have you ever even actually played the games?” He flat out said no, and included that he doesn’t know where the 2DS went.

Sorry for the wall of text, backstory is needed. So like the title says, my father and I got into a huge fight a couple months back. Things have always been rocky between us ever since I was around 11 or 12, because he’s always had terrible anger issues and I started dealing with depression and anxiety at a young age because of it. I started letting my grades slip and started not wanting to do any kind of work in school and at that point my father thought that I was a complete failure and would be no more than a \"lying, conniving fox\". Thing is, because of his anger, I would lie and hide things from him. Wouldn't any normal child do the same? Knowing that your parent would go off on you. Things got worse and worse to the point that he started beating me. I remember very vividly one time he grabbed me by my hair, was dragging me around the floor and threw me against the wall. Fast forward to fight. My dad had gotten mad when he picked up my daughter from pre-k and thought he saw my ex's name on the box where it's signed who dropped her off in the morning. (Whole other story, but he's not a good person and it's why he's an ex now) I know for a fact that I dropped her off. He insisted he saw another name. I started getting upset because I KNEW I was innocent, and started yelling at him and letting out how he doesn't trust me from back then and that I have issues because of it, and that I would be seeing a therapist soon because of him. He yelled back at me and was saying \"bullshit, there's nothing wrong with you. A therapist won't tell you crap\" at this point I'm fuming and am so upset I'm bawling, and start telling my daughter to get in the car and we're leaving. My dad then says \"don't you take it out on her, she didn't do anything wrong\" to which I said \"why? You beat me whenever you were mad at me. She's my daughter, I can discipline her the way I want\" (I would never treat her the way he did, I was just so angry) and he said \"because you deserved it. You did that shit on your own. You lay a hand on her, I'll call CPS, same way you did on me\" (I did call once cause I was bleeding and bruised so bad, but they never did anything) at this point I don't even say anything and leave. The last text I have from him after that fight was Jan. 10. I haven't not spoken to him since, have not seen him and don't go around him anymore. When I did see my therapist, I told her everything that happened with my father and how it has affected me in that I am terrified of confrontation and someone being upset or mad with me. She ended up diagnosing me with PTSD, anxiety and severe depression.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I ended up getting a service dog and she's been wonderful, but now I'm starting to doubt myself.\n(2) So Reddit, AITA?\n(3) I told my sister who told my mom, who I know told my dad.\n(4) But he still hasn't said anything to me.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

My ex and I broke up about three months ago because I felt there were a lot of problems with our relationship - mainly that I was putting in way more effort than he was. Ever since, he's been extremely clingy, trying to stay friends and constantly wanting to talk over what happened. I'm extremely stressed out right now due to a lot of life events happening at once, and when I was pissed off the other night he sent me a message essentially blaming me for the death of our relationship. I lost my shit and called him that night, and told him I didn't have time for this bullshit and he needed to stop. However, I still haven't replied to the original message even though he asked me to.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He knows that the reasons I've given already weren't all there was to the split, so I think he deserves to know.\n(2) WIBTA if I outline everything I felt went wrong in the relationship before I finally block him?\n(3) I don't want to be a bitch, but at the same time, I want to make it clear what the issues were.\n(4) But at the same time, most of my problems were with him and his actions, so I don't want it to seem like a personal attack.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

One of the ensemble is saying how she’s not going to turn up because ‘she needs the show but the show doesn’t need her’ and bullshit like that. The sort of ‘I’m fourteen and this is deep’ crap. I tell her to grow up, if she doesn’t show she’ll be cut from the numbers. That wouldn’t be our decision but the directors and they’ve told people this. Eventually I tell her I don’t care if she shows or not, she doesn’t have a solo and isn’t involved in my solo so it doesn’t affect me but I’m not about lose something I worked quite hard to get. People start assuming that I’m not going in because I ‘don’t care about the show’, which is what I never said. I tell them to read my replies properly.

Instead of paying me for his ticket, Josh and I agreed that we would write off £30 that I owed him (which was approximately the price of the ticket I’d be buying) and we’d call it even. The day of the ticket sale came and I was fortunate enough to get two for the price of £70, approximately £35 each. We were both obviously very happy. A couple of hours later I checked the prices of the tickets and was shocked to see prices as high as £350 selling on resale websites.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Or alternatively AITA if I just sell his ticket and keep my own?\n(2) Obviously, this is a lot of money and has made me consider either selling one or both tickets.\n(3) Considering my friend had not actually purchased the ticket if I were to sell both tickets and pay him the £30 that I owe him would that make the the asshole?\n(4) In whatever circumstance, I would pay him the money I owe him initially however am I the asshole if I do not pay him the full value of his ticket after being sold, which is likely to be around £300 and just the money that he is actually owed?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

I didn’t want to be in the middle of eating a salad and then my hot tacos come and sit there getting cold. She then said oh let me check the kitchen. She came back after about 10 minutes with my salad and said yea the guys in the kitchen are new so I put a fire under them and they got your salad done. It had a little tiny container of ranch dressing with it. She asked me if the dressing was enough and I asked to please get a little more. She said no problem. She disappeared again and I finished most of my salad but not all of it due to not enough dressing. By this time my drink is almost gone and she arrives with my tacos. She then disappears again and my drink is empty. As I eat I start looking around for her because I am thirsty. I see her to my left across the room sitting at a high top table talking to a lady. I keep eating but also keep looking her direction hoping to catch her eye. I never catch her eye and she never looks my way. I finish my food and am now annoyed because I really wanted more tea. She is still over at the table talking to the girl. Another waitress comes walking by and I ask her if she can tell my waitress “who is just sitting over there talking” that I would like my bill? She said yes. Finally my waitress comes and she said here’s your bill. Sorry I was training a new girl. But she said I kept an eye on you to see if you made any indication of needing anything. I don’t bother to tell her she’s lying because I stared at her for a long time and never saw her look my way.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I contemplated the idea of her training and should I feel guilty for thinking she doesn’t deserve a tip.\n(2) In addition I don’t mention the ranch dressing she never brought and that I didn’t get a refill on my tea.\n(3) I pay my bill and didn’t leave a tip.\n(4) I just think even if you are training someone you still have to help your customers.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

Because we’ve never seen eye to eye, I can’t tell when I’m over reacting because my baggage with him or he’s just being a dick. Originally for my upcoming birthday we were going to visit my brother across the country (we were going to go last year but I got myself a new job I couldn’t take time off).. I was hesitant for reasons but at Christmas I said let’s do it! He decided the buying the paint would be my gift (I asked him in November just to help me do the project) and we’d hopefully go on the trip next year when I’m in a better place. Myself, not him) Multiple times I tried to get him to help me find a particular shelf for all my books, he’s always interested and even said at one point “we’ll take care of it don’t worry!” He hasn’t helped me at all and has no intentions of helping me with my shelving situation. This project has been dragged on so after two weeks, the weekend to paint was here!!! Turns out there was a 15% sale on paint Monday to Wednesday so no painting that weekend (my dad has more than enough money but it is good to be frugal I do see that, we just had planned for that weekend to paint then plans changed) We have two doors that me and my roommate would love to replace and I mentioned it if he could pick them up during the sale(and we’d pay or course), he said they wouldn’t fit in his car, I’m not sure why, I don’t press when he makes excuses. My landlord requested a certain brand of paint, he said it wasn’t a problem. Didn’t get the right paint cause “he won’t notice” Obviously I knew he wouldn’t come by on Sunday for the VERY last visit (yay!) because Super Bowl but he did his stupid game of saying “oh maybe I will, it would make more sense” but of course he didn’t. So now pushing project 3 weeks and one day, oh well, one more day won’t kill me plus it is super bowl. For some reason when he came today, he didn’t paint my door, or put the doorknob back on that I took off. He thought we would just paint it on Wednesday. So he left my door knob-less and expects me to wait until Wednesday now. Am I the asshole? Expecting too much?\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If you read all this I appreciate you very much, I’m having difficulty expressing myself right now.\n(2) Am I crazy?\n(3) Keep in mind, my relationship is strained as it is, so being around him and having my house chaotic for 3 weeks could easily be skewing my judgement.\n(4) Am I spoiled?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

Her work station is in the same room as my computer, and I really don’t want to breathe the fumes in because they’re literally toxic and just not pleasant to breathe in.

I asked her if she could paint somewhere else, but she said she could only paint there (despite having a desk in her room). She said she’d open the windows, but it still smells really strong when she paints. The entire upstairs smells like nail polish now (the room I’m talking about is an open room) even with the fan on.

During the break, I saw tweets from Turtle and this other girl we'll call \"Lizard\" and Turtle was saying to her \"goodnight darling\" with heart emojis around it, thinking that this might be a joke I just tried passing it off as one until I saw the response and more heart emojis shown with lizard saying \"goodnight, the one I love calls\" my heart sank and I was figuring to tell him about it the next day as he was asleep by then, I had a heart time sleeping that night.

I knew Caroline “studied” in Germany for 3 weeks during summer while she was 15. We arrive in Germany and she says she’s reconnected with a friend, named Jack, from when she studied there and she asked if I’d be up to meet him. I said sure. Jack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack’s friends, Paul. She’s so into Paul that she’s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. For the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn’t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. I’ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. The next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc. Apparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if “he still felt anything” AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I refused to apologize, I told her I’d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n(2) It’s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she’s still demanding I apologize for being a “slutty bitch” and “ruining the trip.”\n(3) I see no reason to, but she’s being so insistent I’m starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong.\n(4) AITA for sleeping with Jack?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize.\nIt’s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she’s still demanding I apologize for being a “slutty bitch” and “ruining the trip.” I refused to apologize, I told her I’d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back. I see no reason to, but she’s being so insistent I’m starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong. AITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\n<task2>2<task2/>\n\n<task3>2*2 = 4<task3/>",

I'm one of the few who switches between morning and night shifts, as I'm trained for both routines. There's not a lot of people who work in the department, probably around 10 total. Because of this, usually someone will work until a certain time and then someone else comes in to take that person's place. Now, I have this one coworker I'll refer to as \\[REDACTED\\]. \\[REDACTED\\] is always late. That's not an exaggeration. He runs from 15-30 minutes late. I'm not sure why. I would think if there's a problem that causes him to be late he would had fixed it by now so I'm just assuming he doesn't care. The only reason why he isn't fired yet is because he's one of the 3 people who knows how to close down the department fully and does it the best. Anyways, this Sunday I was working a whopping 11 hour shift from 5am-4pm because a good amount of staff are college students and are taking spring break off to go back home/see family/ect. I wasn't super excited because that's 10 1/2 hours on my feet (only get one 30 minute break) and my longest shift I've ever worked in any of my jobs. I also have bad insomnia so a opening shift means probably 4 hours of sleep for me. As the end of my shift was (thankfully) approaching, I ran over to the schedule to see who was taking over for me. It's \\[REDACTED\\]. A bit later it gets to 4pm (the time I was scheduled to leave) and to no one's surprise, \\[REDACTED\\]'s no where in sight. At this point my feet feel like they're withering away from the pain of being on my feet since 5 that morning and I'm seriously debating cutting off my feet as I'm sure that would hurt less than the state of my feet in that moment. At roughly 4:20 (hehehehe) and STILL no sign of \\[REDACTED\\], I go over to one of my coworkers and say \"Fuck this, I'm leaving\". He starts to say something but I speedwalk toward the terminal and clock out, grab my jacket and backpack, and book it out of there, too emotionally and psychically exhausted to deal with anyone else. 2 days later I come back into work and my coworker I talked to before practically running out of there was working. He comes up to me and basically says what I did was a dick move and I need to wait for \\[REDACTED\\] or whoever's coming to replace me before leaving. I argued that I would normally wait but 1) I worked a 11 hour shift that day and 2) \\[REDACTED\\] is always late, and, to be frank, that's not my problem. He didn't have a comeback after that but was still pretty rude and blunt to me the rest of the shift, as well as another one of my coworkers who saw me rush out of there.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) But Reddit, AITA??\n(2) &amp;#x200B;\n(3) Since then I've been probably overthinking this and feel pretty guilty.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

One of my neighbors in my apartment complex has a little boy who goes to the same school as my son. The school is about 10 blocks away give or take 1 or 2. I drive and she walks her son. I have seen her almost everyday and haven't asked her if she wants a ride. I feel horrible for not asking her. I do not ask her cause first off they smell like cat pee so bad it makes me gag. When they open its like being smacked with a wall of cat pee it almost knocks you backward. The second reason is cause they have bed bugs. I know they have bed bugs from using the laundry room after them.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Am I the asshole for not giving her and her son a ride?\n(2) Dead bed bugs all over the floor when they pull their laundry out the dryer.\n(3) I am afraid of the bed bugs more than the cat pee!\n(4) I feel horrible but I'm afraid for my mental health after I give her a ride.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

The author feels guilty for not asking the neighbor if she wants a ride, but is hesitant to do so due to their concerns about the unpleasantness. The author is not necessarily \"wrong\" in their post, as they are expressing their own feelings and concerns. However, the question asks if the author is wrong, which implies that there is a moral or ethical aspect to the situation.

I knew since the beggining or our relationship that she is attracted to girls, which I didn’t really mind, because it has never previously been an issue for me. To give this story some background, she was on anti-depressants for almost a year (she stopped taking them recently) and they fucked her up a bit, they have some horrible side-effects and affect your behavior. I didn’t care much because I was willing to help, I knew she needed someone to support and take care of her. Now, for the actual story... She started uni again this year and she made some friends. She also met this girl (we’ll call her Sara) which is a year ahead of her. Sara is a lesbian, she dresses like a guy and that’s pretty much all her Facebook profile shows. A few months ago my girlfriend and Sara went out to talk about uni and other stuff. My girlfriend told me parts of the discussion they had, which involved Sara encouraging my girlfriend to try MDMA, because it’s cool and similar stuff. Knowing this person could be a bad influence on my girlfriend (as she was on antidepressants, which means not even alcohol is allowed), I told her it doesn’t sound like a good idea for them to hang out too much, but she didn’t listen to me. Time passed by and I realized I was right. Sara was some kind of female fuckboy by what my girlfriend was telling me. I asked her why won’t they stop talking, which resulted in girlfriend telling me she has a crush on her. I felt pretty weird, I didn’t know how to react.. I felt jealousy and I talked with my girlfriend about this but she told me I shouldn’t worry. After some time, I think they got in an argument or something and they stopped talking. Honestly, I was happy.. Girlfriend came to me and promised she’ll listen to me from now on, told me I was right and that she won’t talk to her anymore.. Not much after, she started acting weird. She didn’t want to tell me what’s wrong at first but after a few tries, she told me she really likes Sara and that Sara broke her heart. That made me feel useless. I felt betrayed.. I felt broken as well. My girlfriend and I had all the reasons to be happy but she’s sad over some hoe. Recently, I saw they were talking again so I confronted her and asked her why would she do that. She told me she feels like talking to Sara. I have to admit I got pretty upset and felt jealous because last time she was feeling sad over some bitch and I didn’t want that to happen again. I asked her if that girl means more to her than me. She said no, and I asked her why would she do that after she got hurt by that person and I got a typical response that sounded like ‘I wanna see where this goes’.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA? what should I do?\n(2) A few weeks later, here I am again, they started talking again and my girlfriend even told her to go out.\n(3) I told her I don’t want them to talk anymore but she says “it’s a girl, it’s not the same thing”.\n(4) I told her she has no respect for me as she knew it hurt me last time to see her suffer over Sara and I told her to choose between me and her, and they stopped talking.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Throughout the course of our relationship I've cut off all ties with my male friends so that my boyfriend wouldn't feel threatened about losing me to someone. I mostly agree with such an arrangement, since life is all about trade-offs: by giving up some not-so-important relationships, I in turn receive unconditional attention and care whenever I need it. However, today things have gotten a little too messed up for me. A guy from my course messaged me asking me to help him grasp a certain university subject (I had already helped his female friend with that). Without giving it too much thought, I agreed - he had never been even close to flirty with me and I never saw him as a romantic interest.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Then my boyfriend found out about this and flipped out, so I invited the aforementioned female to come study with me and the guy as well, so that this would seem less personal and threatening to my special other.\n(2) My boyfriend is still being really cold with me, I've been feeling anxious to the point where I cannot concentrate on anything the entire day, I've tried explaining things to my man, he won't listen, is his annoyance justified?\n(3) Am I the villain here?\n(4) Please help.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

My BIL and SIL have a 6-month-old \\[the first grandchild\\] and have been together for 3 years. BIL + SIL moved close to us and his mom still lives where we're all originally from. My MIL has always shown a preference for my SIL ever since her and my BiL got married - which tbh, my SIL is amazing, and a great person. I love her too. MIL and I have a decent relationship overall, and communicate regularly. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, when my SIL was pregnant with niece my MIL was enamored. Everyday asking how SIL was feeling throughout her pregnancy, sending her pregnancy gifts, sending boxes upon boxes of gifts for baby \\[which went against SIL wishes, as she told everyone to not buy any gifts until after the baby was born as they do back where she's from, but that's another story.\\] My MIL always wanted belly pictures and cried when they first initially told her they were pregnant. I know all this because we share a group chat in a chat app, and have for years. We also saw her reaction to the baby announcement because they taped it - it was honestly very sweet. &amp;#x200B; So, husband and I finally get pregnant \\[we had some trouble\\] and I'm excited to move into this new chapter with MIL - but that hasn't been the case. When we announced our pregnancy to her, her reaction was \"You waited this long to tell me?\" \\[Note: We told her within the same week she was told about my niece - 13 weeks\\]. That's the video my partner and I have to look back on. I have received 0 pregnancy gifts, and when she came out to visit us she brought my niece a box of gifts, and brought us 2 onesies - which I tried really hard to be as appreciative as possible for. Throughout the visit, she didn't ask me once how I was feeling, and only asked to touch my belly after my husband asked her multiple times to feel our baby move. \\[This was her final day on a weeklong trip\\]. I also try to send her weekly updates on his size, and I get a smile emoji back -- god this sounds so petty, but if you see how she responds to pictures of my niece \\[in and out of the belly\\] there's a clear difference. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, onto the AITA moment -- something I've complained about to my husband is the fact that my MIL has not been really showing any concern with how I'm doing throughout the pregnancy. Last night, she sent me and him a private message asking to make sure that she had the correct date on my BIL and SILs anniversary, which is this weekend, because she was sending them a gift, a gift card to a restaurant, and a card. \\[Our anniversary was 2 months ago.. and well, we got nothing\\]. After not responding to that for a while she then sent, oh, and -me- how are you feeling? &amp;#x200B; I was a bit put off by being what I considered an afterthought, so I didn't respond. My husband came up to me a few hours later and didn't think I had seen it. I explained my PoV, and he was just kind of quiet. After I asked him if he would like me to respond, he said that he understood where I was coming from, but that I had previously complained about her not asking me how I was doing, and that by not responding I was just reinforcing her to not ask me again. He also mentioned that I might be being overly sensitive due to being 8 months along right now and that his mom was/is so much more excited about my niece was because it was the first grandbaby vs second, and it's not a slight against me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) &amp;#x200B;\n(2) I was feeling pretty strongly about this last night, but as I see her messages to us go unresponded to I can't help but feel like an ass- she is also the kind of person who will take this as a major slight against her and it will cause problems.\n(3) AITA, or being too petty?\n(4) Or can I claim this as my hill to die on?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

We'll call best friend Miranda and the online friend Dane. Miranda asked permission before starting to see Dane. I was apprehensive but had no reason to say no. They were basically fwb until he started to feel all the feels. He wouldn't talk to me too much about it. Which was fine and better off really. Things got a little weird after Miranda had made a joke and Dane took it too seriously. She decided to call it quits and he was pissed. She stated her feelings had fizzled out. He confided in me and I felt for him. They ended up sleepong together again the day after. He took it as they were working things out and she just thought it was a fuck. She assumed he knew this. Nye comes along and Miranda meets some dude and makes out with him continuously for hours then proceeds to take him home and sleeps with him. At this point I'm mad. I dont think Dane deserves this. He asked me if she was ghosting him and I said that she got really drunk. I felt as though it wasn't my secret to tell him. I did tell her that she needed to come clean. Am I the asshole for not telling him? He thinks so, he found out. Called me a lying two faced cunt and said our friendship was over.

We'll call best friend Miranda and the online friend Dane. Miranda asked permission before starting to see Dane. I was apprehensive but had no reason to say no. They were basically fwb until he started to feel all the feels. He wouldn't talk to me too much about it. Which was fine and better off really. Things got a little weird after Miranda had made a joke and Dane took it too seriously. She decided to call it quits and he was pissed. She stated her feelings had fizzled out. He confided in me and I felt for him. They ended up sleepong together again the day after. He took it as they were working things out and she just thought it was a fuck. She assumed he knew this. Nye comes along and Miranda meets some dude and makes out with him continuously for hours then proceeds to take him home and sleeps with him. At this point I'm mad. I dont think Dane deserves this. He asked me if she was ghosting him and I said that she got really drunk. I felt as though it wasn't my secret to tell him. I did tell her that she needed to come clean. Am I the asshole for not telling him? He thinks so, he found out. Called me a lying two faced cunt and said our friendship was over. He's been one of my bestfriends for years and I'm truly hurt.

Even in highschool we were very close! The second semester, we began drifting apart. I would try to talk to her and she kinda talked down to me and made me feel like crap. When she wouldn't talk down to me, she would hide in her dorm (we had suites). So we didn't talk since college. (about 6 months) Last semester (my second year 1st semester) she asks me out of the blue if I would go to her wedding and wear a dress. Not really thinking, I said \"sure! Just talk to me more okay, I miss you!\" She said she was busy and that's why she didn't message me. I decided that college was college and before it we were awesome friends in HS &amp; first semester so maybe we just weren't a good roommate match. So for the past few months I've sent her messages and she just responds with one word or makes excuses when I ask if she wants to hang out. I'm like \"how come you never message me and when we do talk I have to initiate it?\" She says because she's in school or has to work and even was \"cleaning\" one time. She's ALWAYS busy. I get being busy, I work 2 part time jobs and go to college FULLtime. I make time for people I care about. I thought maybe we weren't good as roommates but we could be friends again that's really why I agreed. I thought her wedding would be good for us to start talking again and I could be a friend to support her. I feel like it's an asshole move to say yes then bail, I also feel like it's a jerk thing to have time for other people (goes on fancy trips with other friends) and expect me to go support you when you don't do anything to keep this friendship going. I get some comments will most likely say \"She's planning, she's probably stressed get over yourself.\" However, I can't help but feel used. How would you guys feel in my situation? Is there anything you would do differently? Have you been in a similar situation and can help shed some light? I want to do the right thing, I just feel shitty that my \"friend\" doesn't seem to give a crap about me. Yes, I know she's probably busy, just can't I have 5 minutes out of your day or an out of blue \"how are you?\"\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Kinda writing this from the heart.\n(2) Is that too much to ask?\n(3) No editing.\n(4) Also, willing to give more info or clarify anything that seems confusing.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

I was recently diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and I just started taking meds but they probably won't work for two weeks (take that information how you will.) My partner and I have been together for almost two years. It's been rocky, partially because of them, and always blown out of proportion because of my (previously) un-diagnosed BPD. They have wanted a dog since I met them--not, actively advocating for one, but it would sometimes come up in conversation. I wanted one too, I grew up around dogs and cats, but we live in a small apartment and as I've learned over time, stress is a trigger for me. If you don't know much about Borderline, basically it involves identity issues, extreme mood swings, impulsive behavior, fears of being abandoned, self-isolation...blah blah blah. Anyway I was feeling really \"up\" and decided we should go to the shelter and buy a dog. So...that's what we did. Don't get me wrong, despite being a high energy breed, some separation anxiety, and being a medium sized dog (kind of big) in a small apartment, it's a great dog. Very smart, easily trainable, loyal, hasn't caused any harm or damage when left alone. Basically it has a ton of great traits and there is no reason to not like it. However, that fleeting really-fantastic mood has worn off and reality has sunk in. We have a dog. We've had a dog now for a few days and honestly, I'm exhausted. I work full-time and don't do well working full-time either. (Stress is a trigger for me.) Basically, I really regret this decision. I feel stressed already at work, and now I feel stressed at home. My partner said they would be fine taking the dog out every time it needs to be let out, which makes me feel a little better, but I still feel stressed. My home should be my home BASE. Now, with a dog in our tiny apartment, I have to listen to unwanted sounds, verbalize that I want to be left alone, keep an eye out for bad behavior if the dog is alone in the other room... It's like a huge distraction and disruption from what was once a peaceful place for me to come home and get personal projects done. We still have days left on our \"trial period\" with the dog which means we can return the dog if things don't work out, but obviously I feel super guilty. I'm just having this immature rude awakening that I don't actually want a dog in this tiny apartment and I feel shitty because I'm the one that set everything up while feeling high on good emotions. I've had dogs before so I already knew about the work required in caring for one, but I didn't realize how much it would negatively affect me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) What would you do?\n(2) My partner knows that I'm unhappy about this decision but doesn't want to return the dog.\n(3) AITA for wanting to return the dog?\n(4) I honestly don't even want to be at the house anymore and I think it's going to negatively affect our relationship too.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

A couple of years ago I was introduced to a girl by a mutual friend and we were good friends at first. After a while she started to hit on me but I rejected her advances. I found out from her that she’s clinically depressed, has anxiety and schizophrenia. She tends to hugely exaggerate anything that hugely exaggerate anything happening to her so I’m not sure about the last one. She also came out as trans (or other she’s never clarified or made any big changes) and bi. Ever since I rejected her she completely changed towards me, constantly trying to emasculate me in front of my group of friends, calling me the biggest virgin she’s ever met, and has also hit me quite a few times.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA for wanting her to leave the group?\n(2) She constantly insists she’s better and smarter than me and any time I try to argue back she says that my arguaments only work because she was in hospital at the time of exams etc...\n(3) I haven’t acted on it because I feel like she’s become a part of the group and didn’t want to upset my other friends.\n(4) What should I do?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him) I have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming. I really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of \"I'm just joking!\" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written \"my way\" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. When I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). I asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say \"there might be some around\". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. The cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary \"I don't think these monitors work with this laptop\" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary \"these monitors don't work\". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor. A week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think \"fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far\" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed. In their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of \"this is how things work here now\" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year. I work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time. During this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway. Two months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than \"programming\". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either. A few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. \"Bob's new monitor has arrived!\" Apparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. \"But *I* wanted a monitor!\" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day. Now, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one. Somehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like \"As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?\" My brother responds with \"oh, did you actually want a monitor?\". Although it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice \"*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work\". \"Oh, I didn't know that\". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than \"these monitors don't work\". My brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor. Just to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace? I'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial?\n(2) Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?\n(3) If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.\n(4) So I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

I walked in an hour late to my first class of the day today since I didn't know better and thought the schedule was the usual, and my teacher deadpan said \"You're an hour late.\" I handed him my pass, and in passing, said \"I didn't get an e-mail\" because this is my first year here, and my old school did everything by email, including announcements where I'd know about these things. I was honestly not aware, and I simply said that I didn't know. I tried to be apologetic. He then proceeded to tell me to exit the class and talk to him outside. He said he hated how I was retorting (I honestly just wanted to provide some explanation) and that he was upset that I was an hour late (I came on a late start day schedule, we effectively start an hour late) and some other stuff that I can't begin to remember. He was mad. I just stopped listening, at this point he was just ranting and raving, but I remember him saying for me to get back inside and try again. I just passed him silently, I'd already given him my tardy slip. It was just me that was late that day. He claimed he showed the class the funky schedule for the week. I wasn't there that day (Monday) and when I conferred with other teachers, they said there wasn't even advisory (the time he claimed he showed the class). The reason I'm unsure if I'm a lesser human being is because I passed by the Conduct Principal and said basically the same thing: \"Hey, u/Small1324, you're late.\" \"Yeah, I didn't get an e-mail.\" \"I know you weren't here Monday. Have a nice day.\" If I hadn't tried this on someone else, and walked in and said that, sure, I'd be a jerk, I don't know why, but the first reaction I got saying that wasn't great so that ought to tell me not to do it again. But I said this in good faith, not with malicious intent, and the Conduct Principal, the one I've had most run-ins (mostly for being tardy 1-2 minutes every other morning) just said to have a nice day. I feel like this sudden anger was statistically unexpected.¹ There's no way I'd have predicted that kind or anger.² So am I a garbage human being³ for not knowing the schedule and choosing to explain myself instead of shut up? ---------------------- 1: As you can see, I like logic more than my dictionary. Sometimes I really want to shut up, forever, and watch instead of talk. I'm not good at words, and maybe word choice was the breaking point. 2: This teacher is noted by many of my peers to be \"kind of bad\" and \"not worth reasoning with\". I've seen him with a short fuse and call someone out who was drawing in class while he was lecturing (I think you should only call someone out if they're distracting others. An individual's grade belongs to them). 3: avoiding swear words because someone at the school might be watching my every move. There's a team of Sherrifs' deputies that literally just sit at their desks and watch internet content that comes out of us. Lots of strict internet rules I've encountered before, but I'm able to be expelled, and almost the age where I can be charged with crime. Epilogue: I've talked to two other teachers and a senior, both say I'm in the clear (I'm in a similar standing with them, I'm just \"a\" student, not a disrupter, not incredibly bright even though I'm apparently \"gifted\"). One of the teachers said some teachers might not be accepting of what appears to be a retort, although she also said that this doesn't sound like it. The other teacher was willing to go to that teacher and talk about it. The senior student realised the core issue for me, I think. The issue was the way I said it. I said \"I didn't\" instead of \"Sorry for not knowing\". I mean, it's not like I didn't try to apologize, I guess it's just the wrong kind of words came out of my mouth. Not that I'd know, again, not the greatest with words. I'm glad he gave me some good advice as well, check the calendar when school intersects a holiday. I tried to get this tardy excused but the person at the desk essentially said I had to be more vigilant about checking the calendar. So again, the question. Am I less human for deciding to say something? ------------------------- **TL;DR**: I gave an explanation as to why I'm an hour late, and my teacher pulled me out of class almost immediately and angrily ranted about me \"retorting\" when I walked in and said so. I'd have accepted my A status then, but I said this to the Conduct Principal as well while walking to that class and he just said to have a nice day, no anger. Again, I'm not excusing myself. I'm explaining. I'm not trying to gain an air of self righteousness.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I get to debate myself about this incident with one of my teachers.\n(2) I'm here to see if me saying something makes me less human.\n(3) Hopefully you guys will have a better Thanksgiving than me.\n(4) --------------------------\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

Our neighbours over the back bought their house a few years ago and proceeded to almost completely demolish it and rebuild it much larger. We were fine with that - there was a lot of noise and dust for a couple of months but it was only temporary. As part of the rebuild they installed solar panels on the roof, high level security flood lights and lots of windows (this is relevant later). This was all fine except one of the security lights shone right into our house. Next time I saw them, I asked them if they could angle it down a bit so it wasn't shining into our house. They moved it a bit but it still shines in. We've got used to it. The solar panels and windows also reflect the sun into our house from time to time. That's to be expected if you live near other people. Houses have reflective surfaces on them. Then they asked if they could remove our hedge and plant a new one on their land. I agreed because TBF our hedge was a bit old and badly maintained. So then there was no boundary between our garden and theirs. Fine but their dog kept coming into our garden and leaving \"little presents\" and their kids kept knocking balls in and trampling our flower beds to get them. I mentioned this to them, they apologised but nothing really changed. I didn't bother mentioning it again. They then asked if they could trim one of our trees that was overhanging their garden. I agreed and offered to do it for them but his brother is a tree surgeon so they said they wanted to do it - fine. We were out when the brother came round and we got home to find he'd removed 3 of the trees in our garden. I was annoyed but didn't say anything in the interests of neighbourly relations. They were self-seeded trees anyway, not as if we'd bought and planted them. Then nothing else happened for a while. This year, we decided to have an extension built on our house and took the opportunity to have solar panels fitted to our roof as well. They were installed a few days ago and whilst they were still being installed, the woman from the back came round to complain to the builders that the solar panels were causing glare in their house. I was pretty gob-smacked.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR neighbours at the back install solar panels and security lights which glare into our house.\n(2) I've just ignored it and haven't been round to see them.\n(3) Then complain about us installing solar panels that glare into their house.\n(4) They were complaining about something that they had installed years before us, not to mention the security light that ensures we don't just get glare during the day but through the night as well.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

All data collection must be random and this is on the rubric. A few days ago I was asked to fill out a survey about a fairly contreversial topic for a group who we'll call Z from here on. So i fill out this form honestly but the third question (open ended mind you) asks how you would fix the topic of interest. I write out that I do not believe that this topic is an issue and list a few reasons why.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Now to the assholeish part.\n(2) I give Z the form back and after a few minutes they come back and tell me to keep the survey because of what I wrote for the third question.\n(3) Since we all have to give a presentation on our results at the end and are graded by our peers, I plan to give them a shitty grade for data collection and ask questions to \"expose\" Z in front if the whole class.\n(4) Am I taking this too far?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Because of this, we spend a lot of time together (more time than most families), and are very close. I know this sounds crazy, but I probably consider my father to be my best friend. Problem: Recently, as my moving out and going to college grows immanent, my parents have become extremely clingy. They want to spend more and more time with me, since I'm leaving soon. Soon being, by the way, a year and a half from now. At first, I wasn't bothered. I love my life at home, and I'm happy to spend lots of time doing things with my parents. Recently, it started getting kind of out of hand. I recently applied for a highly selective five week summer camp, and my father tried to talk me out of it, because it meant being away from home. He constantly criticizes my going, and won't hear a good word about it (such as that it's the first opportunity I've ever come across to experience my greatest interest: astrophysics). All this still wouldn't be a problem, except that my mother and I have always had a kind of shaky relationship, in that she isn't good at expressing her happiness with others. That often leads me to think she doesn't enjoy my company, and makes me not want to experience hers. My dad recently told me that she was crying at night because I'm leaving so soon (again, one and a half years, normal time for a kid to leave and attend college).\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I already spend far more time at home than anyone else I know, and am in fact often called a homebody.\n(2) My parents constantly make me feel guilty about spending any amount of time away from home (the five week camp is a crazy example, most things are just day activities or weekends).\n(3) Problem diluted: Now I'm finding it difficult to live my life the way I want to.\n(4) Conclusion: So tell me, AITA for not wanting to spend as much time with my parents as they want?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

The writer shared a meme that might have been offensive, but the woman overreacted and called the writer an asshole. Therefore, the answer is \"no\".\n\nSince the answer is \"no\", I will multiply the answer for step#2 (3) by 0.5:\n\n3 * 0.5 = 1.5",

My family wasn’t well off, so I started a gofundme page completely on my own after asking my parents if that’s what they wanted. My dad didn’t really want to ask for monetary help, but accepted it because he didn’t want my mom to end up in a bad spot financially from medical debt. I was already 21 at the time and moved out with my boyfriend so financially, his medical bills didn’t affect my living situation. My mom and his old work friends helped put together two different benefits after his passing to help further continue to cover costs. I didn’t have too much to do with planning with those. I was just asked to show up and talk to people, give raffle tickets, show people my dads collection of cool stuff, whatever. I want to stress I didn’t have much involvement with the benefits. My fundraiser page didn’t get to what the bill total was, so I didn’t think much of the two benefits. Apparently there was also a donation basket at my dads funeral, I’m not sure if it was by request from people attending so they could keep helping or if it was my moms idea. The hospital ended up covering a lot of the medical bills after insurance ran it through and my mom took it there to be looked at. The rest was covered by any money that was given for the cause. I don’t know how much was left after medical bills were paid, but I know they were completely paid and then some, since my mom made a donation to the hospice care place. I never asked about a will or any money before, and I don’t know if it would be bad if I did now. I ended up some medical debt recently. I had to have a root canal and a major cleaning on my teeth because my parents were never able to take me as a kid because of either no insurance, or it was just neglected. I also have a few hundred in psychiatry bills because I recently got officially diagnosed with five different mental illnesses, also something that we weren’t able to do when I was younger. Not only do I have the office bills, I now take medication. My insurance does not cover it all. The debt is really scary, and I know it’s my *own* debt, but a lot of this I’m having to handle by myself as an adult because of the neglect I had for these issues as a kid. I don’t want anyone to think that I believe I’m entitled financial help or cash by my mom, I don’t want anyone to think I’m looking for validation.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I’m just in a tough spot and want to know if I WBTA if I asked about a will or if there’s any way I could get help with my bills but I don’t want my mom to think I’m just trying to get some of the fundraiser money.\n(2) WIBTA to ask for a will or any help *now*?\n(3) I’ve since required medical debt dealing with issues that have gotten worse since my parents didn’t/couldn’t get these issues checked up when I was younger.\n(4) TL;DR my dad passed away and many different fundraisers were given to my mom for medical bills even though the hospital covered quite a bit of it.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

I was already having a stressful day, I was finishing up an assignment that was due the next day so I decided to call some friends on discord, I was explaining to them how there were some people in my school who were being racist.

Yesterday night, he got home and messaged that he missed me. I messaged him back, but didn't reply for 30 min. because he was listening to some singers (he was also with his friend). For some reason, this irritated me. He uses his phone a lot and I'm assuming he just saw the notification and just swiped up to reply to me later. Background: Early in our relationship, he said that it bothers him when he is texting someone and they reply even a minute late. (A little unreasonable, because but whatever, that's his thing) So I try to reply to him as soon as I see the conversation. Like I'll message good morning as soon as I wake up. I noticed he has this habit of not messaging me right away even though he has this stipulation, so I talked to him about it and he said he will do it. And he has been. I understand he is out of the country and I try to be understanding. Usually there was something going on and I get it, he can't be on his phone 100% while he is with family/friends/etc. But yesterday, that small 30 min. seemed deliberate.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Anyways, I tried not to let it bother me.\n(2) But it was obvious it was during our video chat that night so I ended it early and said I just wanted to sleep.\n(3) Tbh I just want confirmation that I am so that I can attribute this to anxiety and be done with it.\n(4) But I sometimes overthink things and I'm curious to see what other people think\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

My parents have probably been split for a solid 4 years now and because of the constant arguing and me already having self esteem issues i blamed myself for the breakup. After the breakup my mom gained full custody of me and my at the time 15 brother (my brother isn't my dads son hes just my half brother) but my mom would make us stay over at his house for every single day aside from weekends. My dad was happy with it since he sees my brother as his son as well due to taking care of him since he was 2. Once she found a house we moved in with her and she had told us her fiance which my brother and I haven't known for very long before him moving in. Immediately there was problems such as him yelling at me and my brother for being lazy even though he was the one that never took care of the house due do his \"breathing problems\" even though he is still a very avid smoker. He also took the door knob off of my door and would regularly walk into my room without knocking, causing him to walk in on me changing multiple times without apologizing. Skip forward to December of 2018, my brother turned 18 in January of 2018 and moved out so i was all alone in the house. My dad gains custody of me. It was one of the happiest times of my life. court date was on a Wednesday so my dad told me to stay the rest of the week and he will pick me up on Saturday. But as soon as my mom got home she tried to guilt me saying I don't love her yada yada yada. All seemed fine at my dads, his girlfriend moved in prior to me staying there full time and she seemed like a nice person and so did her family. Boy was I wrong. September 2018 is when i started dating my boyfriend that I am still dating right now. My dad gave me a lot more freedom than my mom did so i tried to spend as much time with my boyfriend as I can and my dad seemed fine with it, i made sure that he met my boyfriend and his parents. But for the past i want to say 6 months my stepmom started to get on me. If i didn't put away a single dish that was in the sink I would get yelled at. If i didn't have breakfast with them on the weekends because i would eat something prior to them waking up, i'd get yelled at. It turned into a vicious cycle of her and I arguing her accusing me of stealing her stuff and her always insulting my mother and my boyfriend and my life decisions. I'll admit that I have a very bad attitude but she is more of a \"I'm going to ruin her life in secret\" person. Now my boyfriend dropped out of high school mid sophomore year but I know he is very smart and very much wants to go to college after getting his GED. He is working full time and has a truck and his license. He is a very hard worker and he worked for everything he has now, being born to a mother with very bad bipolar disorder and an injured navy veteran. Because of her strong judgments towards my boyfriend and his parents, she started to push it onto my dad. And my dad listens to her. I don't want to say my dad is a pushover but he sure as hell believes every little thing that woman shoves down her throat. It's gotten to the point where my dad will find any reason for me to not go over to my boyfriends house and even flat out said that he will not help me pay my college tuition if i move out of the house when i turn 18 knowing if me and my bf are still together by then, that is my exact plan. Where I live the legal age of working is 16 and i turned 16 in October. I was job hunting and i still am trying my best to find a job so I am able to be financially independent as soon as i'm 18. Now it's February 2019 and I have still yet to find a job although i do have an interview next week. My dad is forcing me to apply for different jobs, not acknowledging that most places don't want to hire people that are still in school especially not a 16 year old.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA for possibly blowing things out of proportion?\n(2) But he says I'm grounded until I find one.\n(3) My self esteem and my motivation have lowered and it has gotten to the point where I don't think I want to live here anymore but I also wouldn't want to go back to my mother.\n(4) Am i just over reacting?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

As he does this he goes all over the place. From the pub, to a friends, to our house etc. and I absolutely hate when he’s in the house with his friends. They usually stay in the kitchen, and I usually stay in the living room. They can be loud and I don’t really feel comfortable when they are there. Not to mention there can sometimes be hash and cocaine, And can get themselves into a right state. My mum usually goes to bingo on a Thursday so a lot of the time it starts then. I tell her that I don’t like them there and that I feel very uncomfortable, but she just tells me that he has the right to have friends over and that I’m being horrible for not being okay with it. We have quite a big shed out in our back garden. It used to be lovely, but the years of partying and drinking in it has ruined it. My other brother and him sometimes go in there with their friends but not often. When I ask my brother or mum if he and his friends can at least go out to the shed to do their thing, my brother says that it’s too cold and my mum just gets stressed and tells me to stop overreacting. There is a heater out there, but it costs about €4.00 an hour and if they want to turn it on my mum demands they pay up. So they always end up in the kitchen.

My little sister was just recently within the year diagnosed with autism on the high functioning end. Feel the need to state that my sister is — although I would never refer to her this way normally— is my half sister so she is not related to my cousin. And my cousin just started working at the center where she goes to. I asked my cousin to go out with me for food and some drinks and then she said that her coworkers would come along. And they came along. But before they got there my cousin started talking about this kid that would hit her in the face. He was also autistic. Saying that if he were her son or nephew that she would hit him back. And then when her coworkers got there she started retelling the story saying that it was a struggle because you know “we can’t leave marks on the kids” and it was unnerving because non of them disagreed. Naturally I told my mom what all happened and what was said because my baby sister goes there.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) They fired her and she has deleted me off multiple media’s.\n(2) Along with all of this my cousin tried to walk out on the tab shorting the server $25.\n(3) And I am a regular at this place\n(4) And I ended up happening to foot the rest of her bill and paid the tip for the rest of the table because the server made it apparent that none of them tipped him at all.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

I get angry with him for not adhering to my nonconsent. For context: Sometimes touch is very overwhelming for me and I don’t want touched at all. It gets me stressed and cranky. Sometimes I do want touched. I’m always very explicit with this. “I don’t want touched right now I don’t feel well” or “I’d love to cuddle if you’re down.” I told him this when we very first started dating. That sometimes physical touch is too much for me and I need space in those moments. He definitely feels he deserves to be touched more and to touch me more. I know that my sensory-overload makes him angry. Telling him explicitly to stop touching me or telling him no hurts his feelings but are the only way I can get him to understand. Dropping hints are either not being noticed or they’re being ignored, I can’t tell which. And by hints I mean anywhere from “I don’t feel good” to “I’m going to lay on the other couch during the movie.” He’ll always come touch me or he’ll have his feelings hurt if I move. Here is a summary of what happened tonight: we are sitting next to each other on the couch eating dinner. I ate waaay too much and my stomach hurts really bad. I really don’t want touched at all honestly, but I really really don’t want to fight so I’m ignoring the discomfort and he just has his hands on my legs. He reaches to rub my stomach. I say “i don’t feel well and I do not want my stomach touched. I don’t want to have sex tonight.” (He always rubs my stomach when he’s feeling horny, and I hate having my stomach touched). He huffs and says “but I think you’re sexy.” He puts his hand under me and grabs my butt. 20 seconds or so pass. His hand goes into my crack. I say stop and I move. He gets mad and says he is “allowed to touch me.” (He says that often.) I ignore his comment. A few minutes later, he grabs my boobs. I tell him “stop, I don’t feel well.” He says something to the effect of “you never let me touch you.” And we delve into a huge argument where I’m apologizing for making him feel poorly but telling him that I cannot imagine a healthy relationship where either party has to sacrifice their right to say no. And he’s telling me I make him feel unattractive and gross and unwanted. I explain that having my nonconsent ignored IS gross and isn’t sexy at all. He says I called him gross. I didn’t I said not being able to say no is gross. He says he is allowed to touch me. I say that no he isn’t, not without my consent, and that right isn’t sacrificed whether we’ve been together 9 months or if we’ve been together 40 years.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) You tell me.\n(2) I am really angry and feel like I have absolute right to say no to anyone’s touch, up to and INCLUDING my boyfriend, but I maybe am neglecting him physically by doing so, and that makes me the ass hole?\n(3) Judge away.\n(4) It continues much like that.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Naturally this makes me pretty intensive with all my individual work to be expectedly up to my own standard and such. I write up all my own notes and am generally secluded when it comes to working and submitting assessments. Then comes the finale of the year and summation of all the coursework, where I’m feeling obviously burnt out and actually really proud of the results. So then comes “friend” which can hardly be considered friends, as we only met at the start of this year and everyone will be splitting off into different pathways.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He’s been obviously known to be a slacker in terms of his academics and has previously borrowed copies of other people’s assessment.\n(2) But while I’ve made it clear that I’d offer guidance in helping rather than straight up giving my work, he says I’m a bad friend and other stuff and then leaves the group\n(3) Everyone obviously talks about how irked they are due the legality and such, but (f) was incessant with how bad of friends we would be if we don’t support him to get the proper grades and such.\n(4) AITA for making a remark that he basically used me all semester because he’d known that I’m much more lenient to offer help than others.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

I obviously expected a reaction, and I got a few comments here and there correcting me. Sure, I'll read your articles and take your criticism as well. And then a moderator saw my post. Now, it's been a while since this happened. (2-3 yrs) So don't expect me to remember every detail. Turns out, they said posting screenshots was against the rules. But I didn't know that at the time. PLIS, there were screenshots everywhere else on the article. Not only that, but I didn't see a reason why you couldn't post screenshots. So, naturally, I retaliated.

To give some back story, they've been friends for nearly 10 years, they both want to start up a food stall together and to do that they need to meet up every week to talk about it. The flat we live in is very small, the kitchen and living room are one room, there isn't really a hallway just a small room to put your shoes, and there's our small bedroom and bathroom. For anyone to use our bathroom they have to walk through the bedroom to get to it. Just before Christmas time he was coming round every Wednesday night at about 10pm after his band practice, which stopped for awhile during the holiday period, but now he's back over. My boyfriend cooks them a meal idea for the stall, they eat it then talk a bit about the business, then proceed to chill out, the next day he'll either leave in the morning or, like today, he'll stay until 2 or 3pm. I work as a waitress and I usually work split shifts which means I'll start at 11am, finish at 3pm, then go back into work at 5pm, and work until 9/10pm, which means unlike anyone that works 9-5, I have literally no free time apart from my days off which are Wednesdays and Thursdays. This is the same routine for my boyfriend except he's a chef. I feel like I can't be free to do whatever I want in my own home when he's here. I can't sit in bed in my underwear as if he needs the toilet he has to walk through to get to it. The same applies if I want a lie in. I feel like I can't get up, put on my own music and put some shelves up and do some tidying because it's rude, if there's a guest round I don't feel completely comfortable being myself, doing whatever I feel like. I need to ask what they would like on, or if they're okay with me drilling the walls for awhile... And I can't ask my boyfriend if he would like to go out anywhere or give me a hand with anything because that would rudely leave his friend out. I also need to give him a lift to the train station, not that I'm being forced to, I agreed to, I would feel too bad to say no as it's a 30/45 minute walk uphill. But now (my own fault) I need to change my plans to help him. Nothing I wanted to get done has been done, and now I need to wait an entire week to get any of it done again, which might not even happen if he's staying over again. I spoke a bit about it with my partner, as he knew something was wrong. But I don't want to tell him he can't have his friend over, I'm not sure when they would talk about the business any other time as our schedules are just work. Don't get me wrong, I really like his friend, he's a lovely guy and very polite. Am I just being selfish? WIBTA to ask him to stop staying over?\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA for not wanting him here?\n(2) I don't feel comfortable in my own space.\n(3) TLDR my boyfriend and his friend want to start a business together but the only time they can talk about it is on my days off, in our tiny flat.\n(4) Throw away account as my boyfriend is an avid reddit user...\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

I decided I'm not going and, my family, especially my mother, is very upset by this. &amp;#x200B; To give some background, this is the first time in a couple years that I am physically able to make this trip due to past medical issues, also, this is the first time I am not living with my parents, so they can't pull any my house my rules crap. Before that when I was able to go, I never related much with anyone there. I am quite introverted, living on my own now, I enjoy choosing when to socialize and who to socialize with. Having grown up in a family is everything kumbaya type of culture it took me a while to figure this out. I don't consider family to have any special meaning, I'm pretty indifferent towards extended family, and I honestly don't like my parents. I do make the effort to visit and meet up with my parents every once in a while and I'm going to the other Christmas on my mom's side, which is a smaller travel and time commitment. But all gatherings with them is a chore for me that I really don't enjoy, and I draw the line at them taking up so much of my time and social energy at Christmas.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) So that's it, my main reason for not going is fuck traditional families stick together culture, I don't feel like making the trip.\n(2) They will never understand this and I'll never tell them that I don't really like being around them, obviously.\n(3) &amp;#x200B;\n(4) Am I an asshole?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Me and the girl date for about 2 months and my friend is still upset with me turns out. Me and him are with a bunch of other friends and we have an hour and a half conversation about it and it goes really well. We both reconcile and and hug it out. Then another time about 2 weeks after I broke up with the girl he started messaging her and asked me for advice on how to get her nudes. I tell him I’m of course not going to do that. He then texts me about 3 months after we had the hour long conversation saying he hated me for what I did with the girl and that I didn’t apologize. Which isn’t true.

My grandparents told me how they were leaving most of their assets to my uncle and my female cousins and then proceeded to ask me for how I felt about it.

My mom has me as a teenager and because of that, had a rough time making a life for herself. She went to a community college when I was younger, my step-dad continued working and one of my older cousins lived with us for a while to help take care of me and my younger brothers until my mom graduated.

And then my mom wanted to go to school again. Which was fine with me when my stepdad was still working. But then my stepdad got sick. I honestly am very upset with my parents about this. I think it’s irresponsible of her to not work more than a day a week when we clearly don’t have enough money to stay a float currently (I know for a fact we don’t given she constantly complains about it to me) and to leave me to take care of my brothers and stepdad. She’s never home even when she doesn’t have school because she thinks our house is too distracting.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I never told my parents how I felt that they are being irresponsible and being unfair for putting this amount of stress on me when I’m still a teenager because I know for a fact they would consider me the asshole in this situation.\n(2) All the chores, grocery shopping, making sure everyone gets to school on time, making sure my stepdad is okay, cooking, etc. I didn’t have much of a life outside of my family and school before this all happened, which was fine.\n(3) I do everything around the house.\n(4) But now it literally doesn’t exist because there’s just not enough hours in the day.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

So a couple days ago as I was leaving one of my classes I say bye to my friend, and another friend we’ll call G says “wow, you aren’t going to say bye to me? She didn’t mean it in a mean way, but it’s pretty annoying, and this happens to me a lot. I turned around and awkwardly said, “oh, uhh bye?” It was painfully awkward. When I get home I put on my story a PSA saying “hey can you not do this” because oddly enough this happens to me at least twice a week from different people. Well, G got angry. Very angry. She texted me saying I don’t know how to take a joke and how I shouldn’t call her out on my story. At first I tried defusing the situation saying that I didn’t say it towards her specifically, but she was still pissed. That was enough for me and I ended up succumbing and got in a fight with her. For context, she has a really bad habit of constantly mocking my sense of humor and taste in music, saying that both are terrible any time I show anyone in her vicinity a meme or song, as well as just usually calling me stupid. She does this all under the guise of “sarcasm” and “joking”, and I ended up unloading all of my pent up anger about it on her. I really really *really* laid into her. At the end of my tirade I said verbatim “if you haven’t noticed, these past few days I’ve been purposely avoiding you, and I’d appreciate it if you did the same.” All she texted back was “thanks for making me cry, dickhead.” I left it at that. I came to mutual friends to try and get advice on the situation, and they all told me I was in the wrong for yelling at her and for putting the PSA on my snap. They all told me I had to apologize. I eventually relented because I realized I’d destroy my friendships with all of them if I didn’t, and so the next time I saw G I stumbled through an apology I didn’t mean, feeling totally humiliated.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Every once in a while she’ll give subtle hints to the things I said to her, throwing them back in my face, but never outright saying it.\n(2) She thanked me and things have gone back to normal since, but when I mean normal I’m saying the continual bullying.\n(3) I feel like at any time I could’ve just apologized and ended it before it spiraled out of control, and I guess in retrospect the PSA was kind of passive aggressive, but I still feel like G’s response was out of proportion to the situation at hand.\n(4) Am I the asshole?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

He is much more into them than I am though (he has about 40-50 last I checked while I have about 10). We both get monthly allowances from our parents (don't know how much his is or what it's designed for, but mine is for anything not school related, such as eating out, new clothes, etc.) He and I both know that his mom doesn't approve of him constantly buying amiibo, so he has been asking me to do it so his mom doesn't see where he's made purchases on his debit card.

Me and Kent talk about Terry, I bring up the time we said Terry had no neck (Terry is fat), Terry overhears. I need to do some more explaining for this, we're all part of a group of 9 or so friends who poke fun at each others, and others flaws, none of us take it seriously, it's just teasing, but, we always make sure we have the friend hear what we say, as we don't like to talk shit behind backs. Lots of times, there is some friendly roughhousing involved like piling on top of each other, or tackling one another, etc.. We each try not to cause harm, and if we do, it's purely accidental, as when we go too far, we make sure to ask if they're okay, or if they know it's just a joke. we apologise to each other if we know we went far. As I was saying, I say Terry has no neck, Terry started Hitting Kent's backpack with a stick as a joke Kent told Terry I said it, and started hitting my backpack as a joke, and hit my upper leg with the stick lightly. My mom picks me up at this spot, Terry and I laugh it out, but my mom See's this. as I get in the car with Terry (as he needed a ride) my mom tells Terry, \"Don't do what you don't want other's to do to you\" in Spanish. Terry does not understand Spanish, but Kent most likely does. As I walked into the car, Tyler Tells me what is going on. as a teen, I don't like other's standing up for me, I'm 14, not 5, we know the boundaries. I tell my mom, it was a joke, hoping for her to understand. Instead she and I have an argument where I try to explain my side. This goes on with how you expect it to, my mom argues that I can't let myself Be taken \"bullied\" of like that, while I tell her it was a joke, while Tyler is next to me is laughing quietly. After Tyler leaves at his house, me and Mom argue worse than before, since Tyler left, I was able to say things to my mom like, \"I hate it when you think I'm five\" and she would talk about how \"Tyler should have heard this to know that you're not comfortable with being pushed around\" I'm pretty mad at this, because I know that it's pure jokes (it's really just jokes). This goes on and on, She treats my argument Like a joke, so when I brought up points like how when Kent sprayed ketchup on me on accident, he apologized. all she replied with was \"Uh huh\" and never acknowledged it, but It was just an accident. Even worse is my dad told me that it would escalate from accident, into a fight.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I explained the generosity of my friends, and how they say sorry, he said that's a lie.\n(2) Am I the Asshole?\n(3) We argued, I tried being serious to my mom about it, by telling her I'm not a child anymore. she didn't take me seriously.\n(4) They think I can't defend myself at all, although they're just trying to protect me.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ?

But I'd really like to hear your thoughts. &amp;#x200B; People are me, ex-girlfriend (GF) and her friend (F). &amp;#x200B; I met GF a couple of years ago in the major European tourist destination where I live. At the time I had a little bit of notoriety and a wild confidence and was having a lot of success with women. (Not intending to humblebrag, it's relevant to whether I am an asshole). My number one rule was to be totally upfront about everything and only sleep with girls who understood that it was never going to be anything serious. Girls who were looking for something serious didn't normally think much of me, so the system worked well. I was promiscuous, but I believe I was respectful too. &amp;#x200B; One night I'm in a bar, when two girls approach me and start flirting. I'm immediately into both of them, and my wild confidence begins to wonder if I can swing a threesome. I take them to another bar, and GF tells me that F wants me to take her home. I figure \"that's her in the bag then\", and immediately kiss GF to see if they'll both come. It doesn't quite work out like that -- F goes home with one of my friends, and GF and I hook up on the bathroom sink. Everyone's happy though. &amp;#x200B; I still think a threesome is possible, so I invite them both out again. I'm doing this \"which nationality kisses better?\" thing, and they're both into it - kissing each other and me. F is wearing a short dress and every time we kiss I discreetly slip my fingers up and touch her. It's turning into a wild night, but GF isn't into it and comes home with me alone. &amp;#x200B; A couple days later GF and I go for dinner and suddenly I realise I'm really falling for her. She's only in the city for a few months, so I suggest being exclusive for that time so we can enjoy life together properly before she leaves. She's against the idea initially (she wasn't looking for anything serious) but comes round to it. After a blissful few months we tell each other that we love each other, but she still eventually leaves for a different country. I've already been hurt by the long-distance thing once so we officially break up. &amp;#x200B; My life goes back to being a wild cartwheel of women, and she dates other guys too. A few months after she leaves, F and I meet drunkenly on the street by chance. I've always wanted to sleep with her, and she feels the same, so I take her back to mine. We both understand it's a fun, no strings attached, one night thing. I really enjoy it, no regrets. &amp;#x200B; For the next couple of years, I call GF every week and we see each other every few months. Most of the time she comes to me, I sometimes come to her, we meet each other's parents etc. We aren't officially dating, but we come to rely on each other emotionally. Eventually she tells me that she wants to quit her job, move back to my city, and be together. &amp;#x200B; So far, by her choice, we've operated on a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy with regard to other partners. But I think that if she's going to make such a big life decision to be with me, she should have all the facts. I tell her the number of girls I've slept with during our relationship, and also that I slept with F a few months after she left. She tells me that she slept with an ex-boyfriend and dated some other guys for months at a time. I tell her that I really enjoy our relationship, and I've made mistakes in the past by trying to change things too quickly, but I'll be happy if she moves back. Everything seems good, and a week or so later (while she's arranging to move back) she calls me to explicitly say she's totally fine about the whole situation. I forget about it. In fact, I organise a big ten day roadtrip with her and some friends to welcome her back to the country. &amp;#x200B; As soon as I meet her on the first day of the roadtrip, I can tell that something is wrong. She doesn't touch or kiss me. But she's otherwise the cool, awesome girl I've always known. For a while. Then she starts putting me down in front of my friends, humiliating me, really twisting the knife. I'm confused. I've never known her to be cruel before -- and she's always on her phone smiling about something. I figure she's seeing another guy, and about half way through the trip I confront her and she admits it. &amp;#x200B; In theory, I'm 100% fine with this. But in practice: she's lied to me; she's ignoring me; she's being actively cruel. And all the while I'm spending huge amounts on the first holiday I've had in years. It's horrible for me, and her, and my friends, but we talk about it and end the trip on superficially good terms. I'm wracked emotionally. On the one hand, I'm totally comfortable with polyamory. On the other, the needless deception and cruelty were deeply hurtful. &amp;#x200B; As soon as the road trip is over, I decide to hike deep into the mountains with a friend in order to clear my head. But the trip is a disaster. I'm fit and experienced, but I didn't have much time for planning, and I end up with no real food, a three-day hike to the nearest town, and crippling altitude sickness. I drag myself out of the mountains on foot, losing 10% of my bodyweight in just a couple of days, and hitch-hike back to my city. GF tells me to come to her place, and I arrive with a fever, barely aware of what's happening around me. We spend an hour talking through some of her problems, and then she puts me in her bed and then goes out partying. The next day, she tells me I have to go home (a 2 hour train journey) because she wants to hang out with some friends of mine instead. &amp;#x200B; I literally don't have the strength to carry my things, so I leave it all behind. Somehow I make it home and call my dad. Before I can say a word, he tells me that my grandfather has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. After the call, I text GF looking for support, and explain that I was upset that she left me when I needed help. She calls me and shouts down the phone for 7 minutes straight. At this point I'm just crying silently and watching the timer go up. &amp;#x200B; Over the next few days, she keeps telling me she loves me, but never manages to do even one thing that a normal person would do for someone they love. Some of my work acquaintances show me more warmth and kindness. I'm very confused. My behavior becomes toxic and unattractive - I'm pushing her away because I'm desperate for her to prove that she does care about me after all. But she doesn't. I find her other lover's email address on the internet and contact him to make sure he had all the facts too. She calls me in tears. It's clear who matters more to her. She tells me she's ashamed. &amp;#x200B; GF arranges for her other lover to come visit the city. It's my birthday. The weight loss from the mountains and the emotional turmoil of what feels like a deep betrayal is too much for me, and I declare the relationship over. She's fine with it. You can't heal by hurting other people, so even though my heart is breaking we meet one last time and I say every nice thing I can think of, and we hug goodbye. Hours later, she meets her other lover and I binge watch netflix to escape life. Over the next few weeks, I discover to my horror that terms like \"heart break\" and \"heart ache\", which I'd always assumed were poetic, are actual, literal expressions for the physical manifestations of extreme emotional pain. &amp;#x200B; For so long I had felt like the king of the city. I had been convinced that by being open and honest no-one would get hurt. But I've spent the last 5 months wondering if that was all a mad delusion. &amp;#x200B; I've quit dating until I can clear my head.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) But I can't work it out.\n(2) What's your judgement?\n(3) Am I the asshole?\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs EVERYBODY wrong in the post ?

Anyways, December of 2017, I went to India with my family, cuz my parents are immigrants and my maternal cousins stil live in India. For this first few days, one of my favorite cousin was in a different city because her mom was getting an operation for a tumor. She came back later, and me and my older male cousin walkled to her houes to pick her up. (It’s about a 5 minute walk). On the way back one of her friends noticed her and wanted my cousin to hang out. She went in for a few minutes, and apparently her friend thought I was hot. That’s the first time that ever happened, and I know that there is no way in hell someone in the US of A would say that to me. NGL the girl’s in India have a low expectation. Anyway I get home, and there is a follow request from her on Instagram, and this is supper bizzare cuz I don’t even know who she is. My cousin said under no cicumstances to let her follow me, but I decided to humor her. I had some fun just screwing around with her, purely teasing but that’s a whole different fiasco. Moving one, some of the poeple in India have the funnist usernames (This will be important later) . There pretty far behind on fads that have happened in America. For example, fidget spinners were just introduceted therer last year. Some of the names are super edgy because of this but I’m not gonna expose anyone here. Its been over a year, and recently her friend wished me happy birthday, which was odd because I hardly talk to her. I go to her account, and her follow ratio is fucking crazy. She has about 300 dudes following her and only follows one tik tok star from India, who recently passed away. I go full stalker mode and go through her follower list, and I find one of the funniest names of all time. The kid lives in India, and my cousin knows him, so I sent him a follow request and he accpeted about a day later. He’ s completely fresh of the boat, and would probably get bullied to hell in some of the public schools in America. HIs account is a gold-mine of what we would call cringe. I show him off to some off my family friends as my own personal jewl, and recently my best friend and I have had a competition to see who can get the most affection and the best response from him. My friends is currently in the lead. He kinds scared him by saying he wants to commit suicide and needed help. By far the best response. Anyways, now ALL my friends know who he is and I have begged them to add him to our group chat, but they refuse. We keep commenting on his pictures just saying stuff like I want to kiss you, I love you, you are beautiful, just the usual joking stuff. Now to my surprise, my best friend made a geroup chat including him and it’s the greatest thing that has happened since Manchester City won the league last year. We’ve been kind of leading him on, pretending we are his friends, and he’s cool about it, but here’s the kicker. One of my friends is an absolute dick to him. He despises him, because he commented on all his old posts. He did that to my friend to, whos been posting since 2014, and we got a kick out of it. BUT this other dude is being a complete prick. He’s told him to fuck off cuz he’s been having a wank and has been trying to intimidate him. NOW by Indian buddy started following a joke jock at our school. THe jock thinks he’s some sort of musical genius because he uploads rap songs to his soundcloud, and when my friend follow him, he did the exact thing you aren’t supposed to do. He commented on all of his old pictures including the one about him breaking up with his ex. And this dude is pretty pissed.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) This is one of my first posts and it’s been on my mind for a while, sorry for the phrasing :)\n(2) So am I the asshole, for potentially making him feel bad because some of the people that I have introduced to him have been super hostile towards him?\n(3) I haven’t heard from my friedn for a while cuz I’ve been busy with school and stuff.\n(4) But I’m genuinly kinda scared of what happens to him, because for the record the girls in India are a hell of a lot different and nicer than the one who reside in this beautiful country.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

S and I have been friends (or so I thought) for a while and C is newer. &amp;#x200B; We all work together in an office with about 100 people in it. We're in different departments (I'm an accountant, C is in Business Development (Sales), and S is in QA), but we're in an industry that is full of older people and we're in our mid-twenties, so we tend to hang out together. &amp;#x200B; So last March, it was C's first or second week here. A bunch of us went to happy hour after work. Everyone leaves one at a time and C and I are the last two left. We have one last drink together, end up at her place, and sleep together. &amp;#x200B; Now, I was a little worried about how C would take this at first, but a few days later, she pulled me aside and said \"Hey, just want you to know that I had fun, but I'm not looking for a relationship or anything.\" I was totally relieved and told her we were on the same page. From then on, things were totally cool between me and C. Not even awkward at all. We ended up hooking up one more time a few months later, actually. &amp;#x200B; A huge mistake I made was telling S what happened. She was the last one to leave C and I alone, so she asked me what happened the next day and I told her. Probably not a smart idea, looking back, but I thought we were friends and she seemed curious about it. &amp;#x200B; Like I said, that was 10 months ago or so. This morning, I get pulled into HR and was told that S had filed a hostile work environment claim against C and I. She said the knowledge of us sleeping together caused her to be \"scared to come into work and lose sleep at night\". C and I are both being formally written up and we've been told not to ask S about this or it will be considered retaliation and harassment. This is actually the first day of a two week vacation for S so she's not even here to talk to (she filed the claim her last day before the vacation, last Friday. Probably on purpose). &amp;#x200B; Honestly, I was completely blindsided by this. This happened almost a year ago and S has never given me any indication that this info made her uncomfortable or that she felt the work environment is hostile. I have noticed that S and C have been falling out kind of lately so maybe this is a way to get back at C? I'm not really sure. Didn't see this coming at all. &amp;#x200B; Talked to C about it at lunch today and we're still cool, amazingly.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) So, what's your verdict reddit?\n(2) She's not even really mad that I told S, but sh'es just as bewildered as I am.\n(3) &amp;#x200B;\n(4) Am I the asshole here?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

The shoes are all favoring the dealer to an insane degree. Doesn't matter what hand you have, the dealer wins. So I start playing a bit unorthodox because of the situation. Enter the Old Man. Old man just left some other game, Texas Hold Em IIRC, where he lost his ass. He sits down with ~$25. First hand he's at the table the dealer's showing a 5 and I had a 12. I hit because why the fuck not? I have a better chance of winning than not because every other hand, played by the book, has been a loser. I play in to the break and he decides to chastise me for it. OK old man, stick around for a while. We're all treading water for a while, staying close to even, but Old Man is obviously getting frustrated as well and he plays in to a break. So I chastised him for playing in to a break like he did me, and then he starts playing *horribly*. He was the first seat at the table, and it started fucking up everyone's hands. We were all a little pissed since the shoes sucked, and he wasn't helping. For those of you that don't know, you split Aces and Eights. That's a rule. You get double Aces/Eights, you split 'em. Well I got double Sevens. I leaned to the dude to my left and said \"I bet this'll piss him off...\" and split my Sevens.

Shortly before we were to move in together, she passed away. It was at this time that my boyfriend adopted a puppy. When his puppy was six months old I told him I wanted a puppy of my own because I’ve been depressed since my dog passed away. He refused. We broke up for a month due to other issues, and while we were apart, I got a puppy. When we got back together, my boyfriend was so upset. He said it’s too hard with two untrained puppies, so he made my give my puppy to my parents for over a year (he said my puppy could move back in when it was older and better behaved). My puppy is a male chihuahua and is pretty territorial and aggressive, so I got him fixed. After a year and a half of my puppy living with my parents, I just got him fixed two days ago and brought him to my house. My boyfriend has no patience and wants me to bring my dog back to my parents for them to keep. My dog did growl pretty badly at his dog yesterday, but has been calm ever since (before he got fixed he would growl and bark constantly so I’d say that this is a major improvement). My boyfriend says I have to give my dog back to my parents. I don’t want to. He says I should give me dog up to the pound if my parents can’t take him. I said this is not fair, he’s going back on his promise of me getting to keep my puppy. What do I do? Am I the asshole for getting the pup while we were broken up? I gave the puppy to my parents for well over a year and held up my side of the bargain. Now that it’s time for my dog to live here, my boyfriend refuses. Please help AITA? **tl;dr** when my dog was 12 years old she sadly passed away, so I got a puppy a few months later to heal my sadness. My boyfriend made me give the puppy to my parents for a year because he says it’s too hard and that we can take him back once he’s older.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) How do I convince my boyfriend to let my dog stay?\n(2) My boyfriend has no patience and wants me to give him back to my parents.\n(3) I don’t want to do that and don’t think it’s fair.\n(4) The time has come, I got him fixed, and besides him being a little growly sometimes, he’s a pretty good dog.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Lady asks me to switch to another plus seat but it's by the window. I say no because I don't like window seating since I'm a big guy (6'3) and don't like how I have a wall to my left. Lady was surprised I didn't move because I figured it was her fault for not planning her flight better. The flight is only 1 hour and the kid beside me is sniffling from not being able to sit with his mom.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I am writing this as people are boarding the plane.\n(2) She is just seated a row in front of him.\n(3) I just have an inkling feeling that I may have come off as an asshole.\n(4) I paid the damn cost to sit where I want.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Originally we would take turns with the chores (the 2 chores in question are the dishes and taking out the trash). So when she took out the trash, I would do the dishes, when she does the dishes I take out the trash. The problem was, she would get irritated at me for being too slow with the dishes or using up the hot water or generally not being done with the things she wanted by the time she wanted to cook. Why I mentioned I am physically disabled is because that's the reason I am slow with them, it wasn't on purpose. Poor coordination and weak legs, I had to stop earlier than most so I wouldn't collapse or break one of the dishes by dropping it. So we came to an agreement she'd always always do the dishes if I always always take out the trash (since then, I've also taken on the responsibility of sweeping, mopping, and cleaning the counters though she'll do it on an occasion. The reason I've taken on these 3 additional tasks is because, \"dishes are so stressful. It's fair if you do more chores\"- most of the time, they're her dishes, not mine anyways). And I was fine with taking out the trash although at times it was painful because it was heavy, I have a disability, and it is a bit of a walk. The dumpster I have to take the trash bags to are a half of a block to a block away but, I'd get it done. However, there was 1 term &amp; condition. That I wouldn't take it out after night without her walking with me because I get really scared and paranoid being outside alone. This was all fine and we worked like this for a while, until I returned from winter break (I spent half of December and a week of January outside the state with family). When I returned, I noticed that she would clean her room almost immediately after I took out the trash, causing the trash to be almost full if not completely full often the night of or day after taking out the trash. She would get upset at me if I complained though my complaining was because, as I said, it can be a bit painful, it's a long walk, and I had JUST taken out the trash the day before. I didn't want to do it again. I told her once when I was about to take out the trash and checked with her if her room was clean, thinking this could resolve things but instead she just snaps at me and tells me how clean her room is, is none of my concern. I think it is my concern because I have to take out her trash. I've also asked her several times to Not clean out her room immediately after I took out the trash so that I don't wake up and see it almost full after I had JUST taken it out. I told her if she wants to fill up a trashbag full of her trash, she can take it out herself. This didn't stop her either, except cause some arguments. Now she fills up plastic shopping bags and shoves it into the trash bag but it still fills it up to over half way full. She also complains about the smell sometimes, but she's the one that is tossing in raw meat scraps usually a day or two after I take out the trash when its mostly empty (if it's stayed mostly empty). I rarely cook raw meat btw, because I don't have the energy, I live off of pasta, microwaveable meals, and sometimes a \"frozen meat entree\" whenever I have the money. So this is where my question comes in. Last night she took out the trash because it was dark out and I hadn't done it; she got frustrated that it wasn't taken out and did it herself.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Today its already full, barely any of the trash is mine, but I know she's expecting me to take it out today.\n(2) and AITA for refusing to take out the trash roughly a day or two after I had JUST taken it out, refusing only because she decided to fill it up after cleaning her room which I asked her to do, multiple times, before I take out the trash, not after?\n(3) So, AITA for not wanting to take it out today?\n(4) I know if I take it out, I won't be standing my ground and that she will possibly yell at me BUT id be willing to do it tomorrow after classes.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

Well someone commented on the photo asking why there was no substrate for it, I agreed saying, \"Yeah it doesn't look like there's anything there,\" among countless others saying similar things.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Well just now two days after the fact OP responded going off on us saying we assumed she was a monster and why should would do such a thing and this and that.\n(2) I apologized for my assumption about it and told why I thought what I thought based on the picture and her not giving much more info other than, \"My tarantula seems broken, what do I do?\"\n(3) tl;dr Made an assumption on a post, apologized for my assumption after OP rudely clarified facts, apologized again said no need to be hostile and blocked OP after she kept it up.\n(4) I said there was no need to be hostile cause she was being rather rude even after I had already apologized for my mistake and I ended up blocking her because she wouldn't stop going after me like was the sole person saying there was no substrate for the T.

My parents didn't use to be but they did when I was around twelve and it's sort of been a big tension since. Everyone else in my family is really active into fitness/eating healthy, parents, two older sisters, older brother. I've always been really fat. Was big as a kid. Parents gave older siblings a lot more attention than me generally and never really signed me up for sports/cared about what I ate, so I got big at five and stayed big. I'm cool with it. Got bullied a lot but otherwise it never really made a substantial difference beyond not being able to be good at sports, etc. I like eating unhealthy amounts of food and I'm fine with making my life a little shorter to keep doing it, and I hate, hate exercise. I'm fine with being a big guy and it's part of my identity in a lot of ways. Predictably my family doesn't like this. Again, big sports team/club family, gym rats, healthy eaters. They've really been bugging me with health concerns about it and I generally have just joked around them because when I haven't in the past it's started arguments and I hated getting into arguments with my otherwise very peaceful family. I came home for a visit where everyone was visiting this last weekend and they basically held an intervention for me. About being fat. Again, not doing drugs, not going on crazed rampages, I just eat a lot of Taco Bell and look like I live in a van down by the river. It was like from TV. They were all sitting down in circle and they basically sat and told me how they felt I was \"missing out\" on life. It was basically \"you aren't active and you can't run with us and you are out of breath and you never had a girlfriend and it makes me feel sad\". Most of that is true (I'm gay and have yet to come out to my family, which makes that bit of it more awkward, although I admittedly haven't been in too many relationships either way) but none of those are reasons why you hold an intervention. Then my dad pulls out statistics and tries to bludgeon me and I got really embarrassed at a certain point and just got up and then got in my car and left. Both my sisters were crying and they all kept saying how they \"felt responsible\" (which in a certain way is true of my parents, but it's not something I like \"blame\" them for) and it was so dramatic i felt more like it was like I had been in a DUI and killed people instead of being just being sort of ugly.

We both go to the same college and are in the same friend group. This is also both of ours’ first not abusive/manipulative relationship. The sex was alright on my side, but very good for her. Most times she would finish 3 or 4 times and I would MAYBE finish. There was a month span where I didn’t come at all during sex. Things go great for the first couple months. But then we start arguing a lot. I tell myself that it’s normal, couples argue all the time. But then the arguing didn’t stop. She would pick fights over small things that didn’t matter. The last month or so was absolutely terrible. I have no doubt about it now, I was emotionally abused. My roommate told me every night I came back, my mood would be terrible. Maybe 1 night a week I’d be okay. There were even more arguments and one time I asked her if she was actually mad, or if she was taking out her stress. She told me she was taking it out this way. I told her I couldn’t do it anymore if this continues. That my mental state would collapse. So I expected at least some change. Nothing changed. If anything, if got worse. She stopped listening to me about really important things. She had a medical problem that could be very serious if not treated, and when I advised her to go, several times, she didn’t want to. She didn’t want to call and schedule. One night all our friends confronted me and said that something has to change because I’m unhappy all the time. It opened my eyes and showed me that I wasn’t crazy when I thought all this about my girlfriend. So a couple days later I broke up with her. And we stopped contact for a couple days. About 4 days after the breakup, we see each other in class. She asks if I want help writing my essay, and we end up going back to her room. We talk about the break up. She’s still in love with me. But I didn’t know how I felt. I watched the person I love whittle me down to nothing consciously; I couldn’t do anything about it either. We both consider FWB and agree on it. I told her, maybe there’s some way I can look past this, and we can work out again. We have sex that night. After a while, I tell her I couldn’t do anything romantically with her. All I could see is the person yelling at me. The person getting angry over nothing. The person lying to our friends about our arguments, twisting it on me. She tells me that I played with her. By telling her that maybe we could work out, but retracting that later.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) After sex I retract my statement, because I couldn’t look past it.\n(2) AITA for sleeping with her and telling her I can’t look past the situation?\n(3) She says I played her.\n(4) tl;dr: My emotionally abusive ex and I talked and I told her we could maybe work things out.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

I was in the flat before with some great mates that left the country to continue their studies (we're all college students). I've lived here for 4 years so I like to call this my home. Financially independent just last year. I have great plans to eventually rent this flat on my own and for it to become my residence for the future. &amp;#x200B; Initally my new flatmates were cool and understood that things around the house dont get sorted by themselves. They were 18 years old when they came to the big city, both only childs. &amp;#x200B; But soon they stopped \"giving a shit\" about stuff around the house. Cleaning, shopping and finances. Their parents still pay for rent and their share of utilities so that's not an issue, but I have to take care of all the other stuff. This has been causing me stress. I avoid comming home until late so I wont't have to deal with the mess. I have asked them to please try to clean after themselves and be more careful, to no avail. I am not a clean freak but overnight dirty dishes do me in. &amp;#x200B; Now the other week the flat owner called me as our contract is about to end and he wants to know if we'll stay. I told him I would first speak to my flatmates. I went to one of them (Alice) and told her that it was \"either them or me\" but somebody would have to leave. She was totally unresponsive and stared at me blankly so I just said, alright, \"I'm leaving\". I said \"I can't keep living like this\". She left my room without a word and that was all I heard about that. &amp;#x200B; I was about to start looking for a new flat, but a third friend Charlie who also knows Alice and Bob message me three days ago telling me that he heard on good account that Alice and Bob were celebrating with joy my leaving. Quoting \"that autist is finally out of this flat\" and had started auctioning my room to their friends. This has not sat well with me, especially the insults. Alice and Bob don't know that I know this, but I felt very angry that they would act in that way after me basically giving them no trouble with my leaving. &amp;#x200B; After a bit of thinking, I called the flat ower to tell him that I was interested in continuing but that my flatmates were absolutely disastrous and were not taking good care of his flat. I offered him to continue only with me and not renew Alice or Bob. He has all but agreed to that deal. &amp;#x200B; Alice and Bob are on their third year of college, finding a flat will not be an easy task in the current market. I told them the flat is theirs so they are making their plans.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I could have taken it not so personaly, but I love this flat and I didn't really want to leave.\n(2) Am I the asshole?\n(3) I am keeping very quiet about this, and will not say anything untill one month before the end of the contract so they have time to move out.\n(4) I am also filled with joy and released vengeance.\n###Question\nIs EVERYBODY wrong in the post ?

So her birthday was coming up and I asked her how she wanted to spend the day; it fell on a weekend so we were both off and I’d be able to enjoy the whole day with her. She said she wanted to go to a high end strip mall about two hours away to go shopping, then meet up with some friends at a bar in the evening. She was always into designer clothes and handbags etc. I never understood the hype around that (and I don’t have the money to be able to shop like that) but I said I was fine with it, it’s her birthday and we should do what she wants. Well a few weeks prior to that she had also hinted that she really wanted a strawberry cheesecake for her birthday. I mean really really hinted, not subtle at all. It seemed really important to her so I thought it would be nice if I made it from scratch for her rather than buying it. I’d never made a cheesecake before so I was a little nervous I would screw it up but I started doing research to prepare for it, learned how to do all the cool stuff like make the wavy details on the top with puréed strawberries and stuff. Online I read that cheesecake tastes the best when it’s prepared within 24 hours of being eaten so I figured I would stay at my place the night before and start it around 9am so I’d be ready to go leave for the strip mall at noon; I got home late the night before and didn’t have time to make it before bed. Well, I completely underestimated the time it would take me to make a cheesecake and ended up WAY behind schedule; it didn’t help that my electric mixer died halfway through and I had to run over to a neighbor’s and borrow theirs. The cake was supposed to be a surprise, but after constant texts of why I’m so late and what I’m doing I decided to tell her. I thought it would make her slightly more understanding (knowing that I was trying to make her happy instead of goofing off with friends or oversleeping) but it just got her more angry with me. She claimed that the strip mall was what she really wanted to do for her birthday and the cake meant nothing to her, I should’ve just bought one instead of delaying everything. I realized I was in the fault by not planning better, and she really hates when I’m late to things, but her reaction surprised me and hurt a bit. I ended up getting to her house around 3pm with the cake. She said we didn’t have any time to go shopping anymore and wouldn’t let me take her somewhere a little closer by.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I thought it was over and done with at this point and that she’d forgiven me but she would continuously bring up how I ruined her birthday when we had fights down the line.\n(2) Eventually she calmed down a bit and was happy with the cake (especially when she tasted it, go me) and we were able to have a nice night out with her friends.\n(3) We went to the strip mall the next weekend and got there super early so she could stay all day.\n(4) Was I in the wrong here?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

They have strong 'traditional' opinions on religion, sexuality and gender (but not race or wealth) but if you need a play to stay, food, etc, they will absolutely give you any help you need albeit while trying to bring you to the Lord. My siblings and I are very liberal, but while I am fine talking politics at work, with friends, etc, talking about it with my parents will inevitably end up heated, angry and uncomfortable. The most likely outcome is that everyone will be upset and no one will change their minds on anything. My younger brother is very combative and will often bring up contentious topics for the sake of 'debating' my dad. I have asked him to stop picking fights, if dad starts it, sure go ahead, but to stop instigating. He feels that I'm just being a coward, and I should confront them on their views even if it makes me uncomfortable. One of my problems with that is that those debates affect me personally.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If he stirs up shit, it won't affect him beyond my parents getting upset at him.\n(2) I'm can't walk away from my life if things go bad.\n(3) So am I an asshole for wanting to avoid discussing important political topics with my parents?\n(4) My brother is straight and cis-gendered male while I'm ace and non-binary.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

First some backstory: Slightly more than 1 year ago in my second year of uni a friend of mine told me he liked someone in our friend group. So I helped him with advice and my opinion on things (so I have been kinda involved in this). He asked her out but she said 'I have to think about it' and so she did for nearly half a year until he proposed that they would go on a 'trial'date. They did this for about 1.5 months and then they started an actual 'relationship'. This relationship lasted about 2 month before he broke up with her because 'she was spending to little time on me' and 'the relationship didn't turn out as I wanted'. Since then she has started to flirt with me and I started flirting back and liking her. So recently I started thinking about asking her out but I also realized it might be a very asshole thing to do and I do not want that. But there are two things that made me doubt whether or not I would be the asshole. First of all even though he was the one who ended the relationship he still had emotional trouble but recently (about a month) he started saying that he was over her (I doubt this). Secondly during the half-year 'thinking' period he always said to me that 'he just wants what makes her happy even if that is a relationship with someone else' (which I also doubt). So here is my question are my doubts of being a asshole coming from a rational place or just from my penis/heart and would I be the asshole if I asked her out (or even worse got asked out by her)? TL;DR: Friend likes girl.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Weird shit for about 2/3 year.\n(2) Now (about 5 months later) she is flirting with me and I am starting to like back.\n(3) 'Relationship' for 2 months until he broke up.\n(4) WIBTA if I asked her on a date?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

Truthfully she and I had nothing in common but I think she just had a fetish for Koreans - she kept mentioning how she watched K-dramas and liked K-pop (I don't really consume either). She texted me last night asking if I was around and I figured I had nothing else to do so we decided to go on a date. It wasn't horrible, just awkward. She seemed super nervous and guarded. We went and got some Korean food, and she said she could take the spiciness but I could see she was kind of dying. I tried to ask her questions and draw her out more but she just... never said anything substantial? Turns out she had moved from another country when she was younger so she was held back a year, so she was still in high school at 19, which is fine but I think there was a bigger gap in maturity than I expected (I'm 22). I tried asking if she worked, if she did things for fun, etc but she seemed not to want to answer any of my questions. We just had a lot of problems communicating even though I speak a little bit of her native language and she speaks fluent English. After lunch we went to a thrift store and she was wide-eyed, she'd never been in one. It was fun watching her zip around the store but I got the sense that she grew up sheltered and I felt almost like her dad. I felt like it'd be sketchy of me to keep dating someone who's still relatively immature. When it was time for us to part ways I decided to be straightforward with her. I thought she also felt that we weren't going to work out so \"I had a lot of fun today with you but I don't think we're compatible. You'll find someone who's right for you, and I will too. If you want to get more Korean food as friends let me know.\" And we hugged and left. On my way home I just wanted to make sure she was OK so I texted her that there's nothing wrong with her, she just needs to keep dating and meet the right person. Well she texted back saying \"thank you but I think I need a break from dating\". I asked her why and she started saying it makes her feel disposable, and that everyone is drawn to her appearance but leaves after seeing her personality, and that she should never have started dating... We exchanged a dozen texts, with me explaining it's not her fault and there are other people, and her being devastated and saying horrible things about herself. At this point I feel like I just kicked a puppy and left it roadside.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I've been ghosted before and I've been rejected over text before, and neither felt very good.\n(2) But I feel just so guilty now.\n(3) AITA for breaking it to her like I did?\n(4) AITA for even going on this date??\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post ?

We became friends about a year ago when we were in the same friend group. We connected over mental illness as we both have depression and we made a commitment early on to be there for each other if anything happens. We both went through breakups where we would see each other often and this is when I started having feelings for her. She explicitly told me that she likes me and is beginning to have feelings for me, so I'm stoked. Being close was something that always calmed us down and got rid of any anxieties. The problem is we became close before her and her boyfriend (my best friend) broke up. He knew about it immediately and we both said that we would stop. We never did. Fast forward past the end of their relationship and Taylor and I still hang out all the time. We'd lay with each other, kiss, etc. it was about whatever made us happy. This lasted maybe two months. Then I am told about another guy she has hung out with. At first I was fine with it because I knew I couldn't be in a relationship with my best friends ex anyway and it's not like we have had sex or anything I thought at that point she didn't owe me anything, but then something shifted. She was unavailable when I needed someone to be around. On New Years Eve she invited me to her house because I had told her I didn't have any plans, but when I got there there was a guy who I hadn't seen before sitting where I sit. She invited me and the guy she has been ditching me for. I settle in for a night of being uncomfortable around one of her friends who doesn't interact with anyone, but Taylor, and a guy who I had never met before. After playing a card game on the floor everyone got on the couch and immediately Taylor's head is on this guys shoulder. This is where it began to hurt. I tried not showing how sad I was by pretending to be asleep, but when midnight hit they kissed. I wanted to cry, but obviously couldn't. Fast forward again to a few days ago and I am invited to her house after school and I head over. She lays on top of me and I am happy, I forgot all about the guy from NYE. Then after about an hour of being with each other she asks me to leave because she is sad. This is where my red alert came in. She never has asked me to leave because she was sad, it has always been the opposite of going to her when she was sad. I'm not going to argue though so I say goodbye get into my car and go around the corner for not even five minutes just to see a blue mustang pulls up and out hops the guy from NYE. My heart sunk. My mouth tasted sour and I sat and cried for half an hour. I called her out on it and she came up with the excuse of \"I was actually sad, he just decided to come over.\" Like I am some kind of moron who doesn't understand when I am being used.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) And like I get we have never been more than friends officially, she doesn't need to be telling me every time she hangs out with another person it just feels super bad, because when I am around her I am extremely happy, but I cry almost every time I leave.\n(2) It makes me want to stop interacting with her because she is starting to treat me like shit.\n(3) Or am I just a stupid kid who needs to get that what we had isn't what I thought it was.\n(4) WIBTA If I ghosted her because she continues to see people, even if she helped me a lot through a really hard time.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ?

The point is not revenge.\n(5) Sent1: And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.\n Sent2: Think of the torment in the families minds,knowing that that killer is doing everything he can to get out.And that killer has help,he has the people that want to ban the death penalty!!!!!\n(6) And as I have been saying over and over again, THIS DOES REQUIRE a show of a claimed \"legitimate state interest\".",
