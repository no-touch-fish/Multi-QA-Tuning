Her team includes the drag queen Vena Cava (Ribier), an explosives expert; a mute, pre-teen telepath capable of possessing others named Talking Tina (BarÃ¨s); and an armed governmental agent named Durand (Perkins-Lyautey). They are dispatched to protect a convent from an assault by a pack of undead monsters when they are attacked by an unknown assailant.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Mallory is approached to rescue the pope, a job she reluctantly accepts when she realizes there may be a connection between her team's assailant and the pope's kidnappers.Tracking the kidnappers to a pocket dimension containing an entire village that had vanished off the map several years earlier, Mallory and her team are joined by PÃ¨re Carras (Collado), a priest trained in the martial arts and one of the bodyguards present at the time of the pope's kidnapping.\n(2) Simultaneously, the newly elected pope (Spielvogel) is kidnapped by strange, masked attackers who resist the bullets of the pope's bodyguards.\n(3) Rather than expressing anger or disappointment, he merely warns his apprentice that \"lust leads to desire for possesion, and possesion leads to murder\", but does tell him that the girl will have to leave.\n(4) The battle leaves Durand dead, Vena Cava injured, and Tina in a coma.\n(5) Their search for the pope eventually leads to Lady Valentine (Vargas), a centuries-old vampire who survived being beheaded during the French Revolution, and her mission to summon Abaddon, a fallen angel that will cover the world in darkness.\n###Question\nwho survived being beheaded during the French Revolution?\nAnswer:<task3>Lady Valentine<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?

The two build the case and arguments for the defense as significant events in the central figure's life prior to his incarceration unfold.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Colin soon overtakes Ranley's star runner and has a comfortable lead with a sure win; but a series of jarring images run through his mind, jumpcut flashes of his life at home and his mother's neglect, his father's dead body, stern lectures from detectives, police, the Governor, the hopelessness of any future life with Audrey.\n(2) Upon hearing Rizal's life story, Taviel begins to realize that the accused is not only innocent but exhibits in fact all the qualities of an extraordinary man.\n(3) A revolution awaits in the wings.\n(4) When the mock trial unreels, Taviel is all set to act as the prime advocate for his client as Rizal himself is about to give an earth-moving speech to defend his honor and address his countrymen.\n(5) Meanwhile, the Spanish authorities have worked out the vast political machinery to ensure a guilty verdict.\n###Question\nWhat awaits in the wings?\nAnswer:<task1>3<task1/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?
