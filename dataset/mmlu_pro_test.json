Whole tomatoes must be composed of at least 80 percent grade A tomatoes, whereas tomato paste must be made with at least 10 percent grade A tomatoes. Whole tomatoes sell for $0.08 per pound and paste sells for $0.05 per pound. Formulate a linear program to solve for how much of each product to make, if the company wants to maximize revenue.
