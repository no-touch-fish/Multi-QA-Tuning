My mother was diagnosed with inoperable cancer 4 years ago, and passed away within 5 months of diagnoses. It was a rough 5 months as my father and I did the majority of the caretaking for her. At the same time a woman I've known since I was 14, (we were in our early 30s at this point), had a pet die. It happened the same night I found out my mother had brain tumors. I tried to let her know I felt bad about her pet, but I had my own thing going on and couldn't be there for her. She insisted on calling me anyway to talk about her cat. Annoying, but my mom wasn't dead yet and my friends beloved pet was. I let it go. Fast forward 5 months. My mother just died. I haven't been talking to my friend much because I've either been busy or exhausted. And a bit I was dodging her calls because all she ever talked about were her cats. But she wants to come to the funeral since she knew my mom and really cared for her. I let her know when and where and that she's welcome to come back to the house for the close friends and family get together after the reception. She showed up at the church the funeral was at and I just couldn't shake her. After the service there was a reception and she followed me around it, talking to me about cats and complaining about living with her father. There were over 200 people at the service, my mom was well liked by her community. Most of them wanted to offer their condolences and as they did my friend kept awkwardly going on about her problems in the background. At one point I managed to slip away from my friend to have a smoke outside and she tracked me down. It was at that point I told her for the second time I really needed a break from the cat talk, and suggested she go say hi to her brothers family. She came back to my side as soon as she could and continued on about the cats for the rest of the day. It was infuriating.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) She flipped out, sent a lot of insulting messages, engaged with name calling.\n(2) I just blocked her numbers and haven't spoken to her since.\n(3) The next day I blocked her from my social media and sent her a text saying I didn't appreciate her behavior and needed some time and space from our friendship.\n(4) I just wonder if I was overreacting out of grief, exhaustion, all the heaviness that comes with caring for a dying relative.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(2)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.0<task3/>",

So for some backstory, I am currently a Freshmen and I know this girl through school and we have only known each other for a few months (Maybe 3-4 months). It all started out with my friend giving her my number (I don't know why). She starts to text me asking to give her something to do while she waits at an airport as she is going somewhere for winter break. Me being as funny as I am. I sent her a gif of Thanos snapping to keep her busy for a while so she wouldn't bother me. A few minutes later she once again complains about being bored, so I send her a gif of Peter Parker being turned to dust. That keeps her busy for a while and she doesn't text me for the rest of the night. We talk the next day about basic shit like \"Is there any homework for this class?\" and stuff like that. &amp;#x200B; The next day it gets weird. Me being on winter break at the time I was going to sleep around 2am-ish and waking up at 1pm-ish. At 5:48 am she texts me the following (keep in mind that we have only known each other for 3-4months) \"It's like 5 in the morning or whatever there and this is really weird but please don't think anything cause I was forced to do this: Are you big? Oh yeah, there was another one too: Do you actually masturbate or is it a joke?\" She then texted me at 6:02 am she texts me \"Sorry for those please just answer them though I gotta get the stuff.\" Then at 7:50 am she texts me \"I'm bored, My sister is taking too long.\" Then the last texts I received until I woke up and texted her back was \"Nevermind don't answer those forget about it I figured it out so its fine.\" &amp;#x200B; So I wake up to these texts and are bewildered by all these very weird texts, but me, being a Freshmen thinking I might get some ass, I question why she wants that info and she said: \"I can't because last time I got in trouble.\" She then said, \"I can't tell you because last time my sister over-reacted and my whole family hated me and they made me sit there kneeling on my knees pleading for three hours and I could barely stand I had to crawl around for like 4 day.\" I brushed it off as her not telling me the real reason, so I go ahead and tell her and she says \"Meh\". We continue to talk normally for the rest of the day and most of the days following. &amp;#x200B; Many days after this she starts to bring up if I have sexual fantasies and what are they. Another very confusing/private question. I just ignore it and she doesn't try to pry and keep asking if I do; until the next day which she keeps prying and I say \"These are completely uncomfortable topics and I am not willing to answer.\" and she gets pretty mad, calling me a liar and other not very nice names. People might wonder why I haven't blocked her yet, but again I thought I might be getting some ass. She then gets very nosy and keeps asking once again and I threaten to block her, so I do and I thought that was the end of it. Multiple days later, after winter break, she starts texting me on a number I have not blocked and keeps asking about it.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA for making her cry after I didn't give her private info?\n(2) So I almost instantly block her number.\n(3) Later that week during school I see her crying and all the private info during that conversation got leaked, so I started to tell people what she had asked and everything she had done and once again today I saw her crying.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(4)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

At 5:48 am she texts me the following (keep in mind that we have only known each other for 3-4months) \"It's like 5 in the morning or whatever there and this is really weird but please don't think anything cause I was forced to do this: Are you big? Oh yeah, there was another one too: Do you actually masturbate or is it a joke?\" She then texted me at 6:02 am she texts me \"Sorry for those please just answer them though I gotta get the stuff.\" Then at 7:50 am she texts me \"I'm bored, My sister is taking too long.\" Then the last texts I received until I woke up and texted her back was \"Nevermind don't answer those forget about it I figured it out so its fine.\" &amp;#x200B; So I wake up to these texts and are bewildered by all these very weird texts, but me, being a Freshmen thinking I might get some ass, I question why she wants that info and she said: \"I can't because last time I got in trouble.\" She then said, \"I can't tell you because last time my sister over-reacted and my whole family hated me and they made me sit there kneeling on my knees pleading for three hours and I could barely stand I had to crawl around for like 4 day.\" I brushed it off as her not telling me the real reason, so I go ahead and tell her and she says \"Meh\". We continue to talk normally for the rest of the day and most of the days following. &amp;#x200B; Many days after this she starts to bring up if I have sexual fantasies and what are they. Another very confusing/private question. I just ignore it and she doesn't try to pry and keep asking if I do; until the next day which she keeps prying and I say \"These are completely uncomfortable topics and I am not willing to answer.\" and she gets pretty mad, calling me a liar and other not very nice names. People might wonder why I haven't blocked her yet, but again I thought I might be getting some ass. She then gets very nosy and keeps asking once again and I threaten to block her, so I do and I thought that was the end of it. Multiple days later, after winter break, she starts texting me on a number I have not blocked and keeps asking about it.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA for making her cry after I didn't give her private info?\n(2) So I almost instantly block her number.\n(3) Later that week during school I see her crying and all the private info during that conversation got leaked, so I started to tell people what she had asked and everything she had done and once again today I saw her crying.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(4)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

She ended up going to a couple of my close friends asking if they could hook her up with a gram. My friends knew who she was so they contacted me and asked if they should or not. I told them no and that was the end of that. Then she asked them again... and again... in which case i WARNED her that i would tell our parents if she didnt stop because... well she is 13, and i firmly believe that anyone under the age of 16 shouldn't even consider touching ANY drug. Then she asked me and my friend again, this time i decided to scam her for $15 dollars since i really didn't want to tell our parents (I'm 17 so i didn't really want to admit i smoked). She is getting her money back because i don't like scamming a family member (or anyone for that matter). But thats besides the point. She ended up finding another friend of mine selling xanax and weed, he told me he met a customer that looked an awful lot like me. I asked if her name was (her name) and he said yes. That was my last straw, i decided 2 hours ago to call up my mom, tell her everything that had happened and that i want her to set her straight without involving police ect.

My relationship with my mother isn't good due to our vastly different personalities, she is very loud and stuff while I'm in the quiet side like my dad. My mom likes to announce every single thing she does while I just do it without making a big fuss about it, be it greeting other people, doing chores around the house, etc. Worth to mention that her whole family is like this and I'm also not on good terms with them because of these reasons but also worse stuff. Yesterday we went to my nanny's house. She's pretty sick atm so I proposed to go and I brought some fruits and money for her medical needs. She lives with her daughter and her kids so when we got there I went and greeted all of them, just a simple \"Hey [redacted] *hugs*\" I did this with every person in the house, cause basic manners and I'm pretty close with the family. When we got to my nanny's room, my mother announced why we were there while simultaneously asking everyone if I had say hi to then \" *Did Frisk greet you? She never greets anyone, don't know what I did wrong while rising her* \" Repeat this for almost 7 people looking extremely uncomfortable. At the end of the visit, my parents were already outside nanny's room while I gave her the money inside an envelope, as discreet as possible cause I know she hates getting money \"that she didn't work for\". When I got out my parents were outside the house and my mother screamed *DID YOU GIVE HER THE MONEY?* I think that every single person in the block heard it and I was so embarrassed and upset because she made such a trashy action in a pretty sensible moment. She also did the *Did Frisk say goodbye to you?* for every single person in the house, again. It's not the first time she does this, but it was so upsetting this time because I feel she ruined a quiet and special visit with someone I truly care about. When we got home I told her that I felt terrible because she was always treating me like a child and also making a big fuss over every single thing I did or didn't do and she just said \" Well, you're always silent with everything you do and I have to make sure you're behaving correctly.\"??? Then I told her that just because I wasn't loud as her and her whole family doesn't mean I'm not doing what I'm supposed to, that there's no need for me to be loud about things and that I've always been quiet, that I just couldn't understand why she was so obsessed with me being like her family, that it wasn't gonna happen and that I was glad I have no ties to such a terrible family (I am adopted) Then she said a lot of stuff surrounding my \"hate\" towards her family and that if I'm against her family, I'm also against her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Hurt feelings ensues.\n(2) TL;DR My mother treats me like a child and expects me to act like her and her family, situation escalates to me telling her that's not gonna happen.\n(3) So that's my question, AITA?\n(4) She hasn't talked to me since last night and I feel that I did nothing wrong, but my dad told me that it was disrespectful of me talking to my mother like that.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(3)-(2)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>6 <task2/> \n3: <task3>3.0<task3/>",

When I take too many of my anxiety pills/antidepressants, I start having horrible symptoms like hallucinations, disphoria, dizziness, and a lot more (It's only a specific one, not all of them). I don't usually take them at all. But, I took it because I get anxiety in tight spaces. Basically, we were having a road trip. We all took turns driving my dad's old van. I took four of my pills because I forgot about the other two that I took. I mentioned this to everyone but they still wanted me to drive. It started getting worse while driving. I was fading in and out, everyone laughing at me sounded like Alvin from the chimpmunks movie. I just wasn't feeling it. They told me that I was saying random things and that I started to act intoxicated. Then, fast forward, it was dark and I thought I saw myself jump in front of the car or something. So, you guessed it, I swerved extremely fast. I ended up crashing the car into a post. I don't remember much after that. They called the cops I guess. The told the cop everything. I went to the hospital temporarily. They let me out because I didn't want to go to rehab or anything. Fast forward, everyone is butt hurt about it and I couldn't care less.

My friend and me were on a vacation at the seaside where we met a guy (let's call him Dave). He was a cool guy overall so we kept contact for about 1-2 years. Fast forward 3 years my UNI made a picnic party. The day arrived and when I came there Dave was there and he brought a girl with him (let's call her Anna). So she was cute but a bit messy. With her dark hair, dark eyeliners and overall small figure not to mention extremly shy, she caught my eye. So we sat down at the same table, talked, drank etc. like every picnic party goes. Then it was time for chestnuts, so we gathered around the fire. We were all just chilling there having small talk when suddenly I feel someone squeezing to me. I looked and it was Anna. A bit drunk but still not too badly, so I decided sure we can cuddle andd put my arm around her. Then the chestnuts were ready so we sat back down and ate them. Shortly after we decided to go home, so we packed a bit of booze for the walk home. Anna then wanted us to walk together and so we did. We escorted a 4th guy. Next up was Dave, and so we went towards his flat and when we arrived there he didn't want to go to sleep yet so we sat on a nearby bench and spent some time there. Then Anna drew out weed and said let's smoke it and so she started. I felt so bad because I had quit smoking weed for quite some time and this gril that was so promising was smoking it. A little backstory for weed as well I suppose. I also have a 4 years older brother and there was a scandal involving weed that I don't want to get into details which made me quit. Anyways so she passed it to Dave and he passed it to me. We drank our leftovers and then Dave decided to go to sleep. So now only Anna was left to escort. We walked slowly to her appartment and we were flirting all the way. When we arrived she was glowing of happiness and it made me feel special as well. So we stood there a while and made out when she invited me in. That's when it hit me. I've felt shivers go down my spine and I started to do whatever I could just to not get there with her, since I knew we would both regret it after. After a while I actually managed to say good night even tho I saw her sad. I then walked to my dorm which was like 40 mins from there so i had time to think everything through and decided to sleep over it.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I did saw her some times at UNI after that and I still do (now she has a boyfriend) but she's ignoring me like I was air.\n(2) The next day however I felt so much guilt cause I had broken my only rule that I ever made: to never smoke weed again.\n(3) I shocked from my actions was trying to avoid any further contact with her, so after a few days of avoiding with lies I spit out the biggest lie of all: there's another girl and I never heard from her again.\n(4) Anna tho was very excited in the morning to see me again.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(4)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>",

We have never doubted the other in our relationship ever. We have a great relationship. Lisa (F21) and I have an okay relationship. We did grow up together, but we just never clicked. &amp;#x200B; Now this happened when she was a senior in high school and Jay and I were 21. I went home for the holidays with Jay to celebrate Christmas with my family. During dinner, I overheard Lisa telling another cousin of ours that she wanted to fuck Jay. I confronted her later, but she said it was a joke. Last year at another Christmas gathering I went to with Jay, she told my aunt she was in love with Jay. I felt bad for her, so I didn't confront her this time. That night, Jay proposed. I saw Lisa crying and running upstairs to the bathroom. &amp;#x200B; Flash forward to now. Our parents, Jay and I are planning our wedding. I specifically told my family that it was only going to be us 6 planning the wedding, no one else. My aunt argued with me to let Lisa on the planning committee since Lisa wants to be a wedding planner in the future. I eventually agreed. &amp;#x200B; I really regret letting her on the committee. Let me list the things she's done so far: * Wanted to take control of the catering. All the food choices, cake, table covers, napkins, utensils, etc. * Wanted to pick out my dress. I said no to her pick, then the started to pout. * Wanted to pick out the bridesmaid dresses. She said she wanted this specific dress because it looked good on her. She's not even one of my bridesmaids. * Wanted to have a big wedding. I said no since both Jay and I wanted an intimate wedding with only family and close friends. &amp;#x200B; Last week we were having another family gathering, and Lisa would not stop gushing about how perfect the wedding was going to be. Then she listed everything Jay and I picked out saying it was all HER idea. The more lies that came out of her mouth, I got angrier. &amp;#x200B; I snapped and started to yell at her. I said how it wasn't her wedding, it was mine, and I could plan it however I pleased. I also said how he loved me and he would never love her. She burst into tears and ran upstairs to cry. I realized how hurtful the things I said was and went to go apologize, but my family stopped me.

At the time I was 15, and he would often talk to me as a sort of 'therpist'. Around that time I started becoming more independent and isolated myself more from my family - a few years prior however, my dad and I were extremely close. I just took my growing independence as a normal feat of growing up. Anyways, so one day when I was 15 he was confiding in me about his depression, when suddenly he started confronting me about how I no longer spent time with him. Then he kinda got tearfully angry and told me that I'm the reason he is suicidal/I make him suicidal. This definitely bothered me at the time, but I was more resentful/angry than anything. I've remembered the incident quite clearly since then. Fast forward to today, my 18th birthday, and I'm sitting down with my parents at the table (a very rare occassion) and we're just talking. I definitely have alot of resentments towards my family and my upbringing (I come from a fairly dysfunctional family, and my upbringing has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster) and towards both parents, but I was actually enjoying myself while we were talking. Recently I asked to get an appointment with a psychiatrist and begin therapy again, as I've been struggling with what I think is worsening depression over the last few months. So we talked a bit about that. We talked a bit about how dysfunctional the family is, and reminisced about the tumultuous up bringing - but in a good light. It was kind of nice,and I actually felt close to them for the first time in years (especially my dad). I don't remember exactly what my dad said to me next (but I perceived it to be in an accusatory tone), so then I brought up the shitty thing he had said to me a few years prior - how he told me I make him suicidal. He vehemently denied this at first, claiming that he must have been talking to my mom (as he accuses her of that quite often) or that I was just remembering incorrectly, because he would have remembered saying that. I was insistent until I noticed him growing upset as he began to acknowledge that it may be true, at which point I admitted that it may have been a misunderstanding (which it was definitely not).\n###List of Sentences\n(1) It is definitely something that has remained ingrained in my.mind, and I've told my mom about it, but never brought it up with my dad.\n(2) This then triggered me, and now I'm in bed succing on a cigarette and feeling like a total asshole for having brought that up.\n(3) Now I'm worried that he is suicidal again.\n(4) My mom made us hug and then he burst into tears, very obviously hurt, and started lamenting about what a shitty thing that was/how he's a bad person.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(3)-(2)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>6 <task2/> \n3: <task3>3.0<task3/>",

At the time I was 15, and he would often talk to me as a sort of 'therpist'. Around that time I started becoming more independent and isolated myself more from my family - a few years prior however, my dad and I were extremely close. I just took my growing independence as a normal feat of growing up. Anyways, so one day when I was 15 he was confiding in me about his depression, when suddenly he started confronting me about how I no longer spent time with him. Then he kinda got tearfully angry and told me that I'm the reason he is suicidal/I make him suicidal. This definitely bothered me at the time, but I was more resentful/angry than anything. I've remembered the incident quite clearly since then. Fast forward to today, my 18th birthday, and I'm sitting down with my parents at the table (a very rare occassion) and we're just talking. I definitely have alot of resentments towards my family and my upbringing (I come from a fairly dysfunctional family, and my upbringing has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster) and towards both parents, but I was actually enjoying myself while we were talking. Recently I asked to get an appointment with a psychiatrist and begin therapy again, as I've been struggling with what I think is worsening depression over the last few months. So we talked a bit about that. We talked a bit about how dysfunctional the family is, and reminisced about the tumultuous up bringing - but in a good light. It was kind of nice,and I actually felt close to them for the first time in years (especially my dad). I don't remember exactly what my dad said to me next (but I perceived it to be in an accusatory tone), so then I brought up the shitty thing he had said to me a few years prior - how he told me I make him suicidal. He vehemently denied this at first, claiming that he must have been talking to my mom (as he accuses her of that quite often) or that I was just remembering incorrectly, because he would have remembered saying that. I was insistent until I noticed him growing upset as he began to acknowledge that it may be true, at which point I admitted that it may have been a misunderstanding (which it was definitely not).\n###List of Sentences\n(1) It is definitely something that has remained ingrained in my.mind, and I've told my mom about it, but never brought it up with my dad.\n(2) This then triggered me, and now I'm in bed succing on a cigarette and feeling like a total asshole for having brought that up.\n(3) Now I'm worried that he is suicidal again.\n(4) My mom made us hug and then he burst into tears, very obviously hurt, and started lamenting about what a shitty thing that was/how he's a bad person.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(3)-(2)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>6 <task2/> \n3: <task3>3.0<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

So to summarize what’s been going on for the passed 2 months, it’s been borderline illegal disputes and common courtesy thrown out the window. Basically she uses her friend’s death to excuse her from any responsibilities; she never cleans, never pays rent and bills on time, treats us all like shit, and constantly threatens suicide and almost brags about the amount of sleeping pills she takes a night in hopes she takes 1 pill too many and kicks the bucket.

I care about her wellbeing but I’m at my wits end with her.

He was also unhappy with his current job (truck driver) and since he was always interested in computers I started teaching him programming and got him an apprenticeship at the company I work at. After above mentioned things were dealt with, everyday life began to settle in again and I'd frequently visit him as usual. The difference now is that we don't have a dedicated room to chill in and play video games together and talk about private matters. Everything is now in the living room, with his gf visibly annoyed and more people visiting now since a good friend lives in the same apartment complex, so things get a lot easier heated nowadays. I'll be moving into a new place in 2 months and asked my friend if he wanted to help me with planning the apartment and such since he is experienced with that. He said yes and we waited until the floor plans arrived. I asked him multiple times when we wanted to go to some furniture places together to get some ideas (I wanted him to come with me since I want to make one of the rooms I'll have our dedicated place again, but this time I wanted it to be like a thing we designed and made together). He postponed the date when we would go multiple times because he either forgot it or wanted to stay home because he \"doesn't like to go to furniture places and just wants to chills at home\", which got me a little mad yesterday because he's on sick leave since two weeks (he isn't sick) and has been playing games since then (which imo is perfectly fine, but weakens his argument of wanting to chill imo). As soon as another friend came in and got wind about that we want to go to a furniture place, he immediately said that we should totally go now, but then realised it's late so we should go the next day then. I later called him out because that's not the first time this happened (like I asked him for something to do outside, he says no, but as soon as someone else would join, he says yes) and told him that I sort of feel disrespected as if I wasn't good enough of a reason to do something outside of his comfort zone.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I hope someone takes their time to read and reply to this.\n(2) Constructive feedback welcome, especially if I did something wrong.\n(3) He just replied \"dude, seriously?\" and now I'm sitting here wondering if I was wrong and the asshole for getting mad and / or overreacting or he is.\n(4) I'm not very good at socialising and would love to improve.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(2)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

My roommate and I talked and agreed to keep the air at 70-71 so that our electricity bill wouldn’t cost as much. It’s mostly remained at 71 because I try to be nice and I know she gets cold. Well, I at least try. Multiple times now, I’ve caught the air back up to 74 or 73, coming home after weekends away to a super hot apartment. Sometimes even if I’ve been in my room too long she will secretly raise the temperature despite our agreement. I have tolerated this for about two months now (we made the agreement in November, she began fringing on it in December). For awhile, I would just lower it back down to 71 and move on. But this week has had nice weather, to the point that without our air on, our apartments temperature has remained at 70 which is pretty damn nice, except she just raised the air to 72 right before bed.

My roommate and I talked and agreed to keep the air at 70-71 so that our electricity bill wouldn’t cost as much. It’s mostly remained at 71 because I try to be nice and I know she gets cold. Well, I at least try. Multiple times now, I’ve caught the air back up to 74 or 73, coming home after weekends away to a super hot apartment. Sometimes even if I’ve been in my room too long she will secretly raise the temperature despite our agreement. I have tolerated this for about two months now (we made the agreement in November, she began fringing on it in December). For awhile, I would just lower it back down to 71 and move on. But this week has had nice weather, to the point that without our air on, our apartments temperature has remained at 70 which is pretty damn nice, except she just raised the air to 72 right before bed. I would feel bad if it wasn’t for the fact she does nothing to help herself. She wears short sleeves in the apartment, no socks.

There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit. So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex). I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening. I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk. So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat.

Last year a kid (whom I'll call Jerry) joined the class. For most of that year myself and my friends never really talked to him. Then eventually we felt bad because he didn't really have no other friends. So, we decide to kind of add Jerry to the group. He seems happy enough and things were going fine until I added him to our group chat. That's when all hell broke loose. First, we had to add him to a separate one because one of my friends (whom I'll call Kat) HATED him. Whenever Jerry and her were together she would just not be for it. So, after Jerry and Kat are separate group chats we realized that Jerry cannot take a joke for his life. So, we have to be literal with everything that we say (which is hard because we all are sarcastic). Once again, it wasn't much of a big deal until Jerry says one day (when for some reason he and Kat were in the same chat) \"Hey Kat I like your ass.\" We were all shocked because he was still new and stuff. Of course we all take offense to this because we've known Kat for longer and we thought he was serious. Then my other friend (we'll call Jub) starts trying to defend him until he says \"Jub I like your ass\" and \"I look at Jub and Kat ass.\" Yeah Jerry was kicked soon after. Jub tried to defend him but the rest of us agreed that he went way too far. Now fast forward to the next school year. Kat had left the school so now there's an open spot at our table for 4 (the rest of the group was spread throughout different classes). Jerry decides to take it. Here comes part two. We notice that Jerry tends to stare... In the wrong places. In a group of 80% girls this is a problem. On top of that he doesn't do his work (a problem for a group of people who do their work) and is a constant distraction. He also starts to be VERY annoying. He will constantly try to peek into others conversations, fake a throw or hit to you and swap pencils. All of us start to become very annoyed. Even Jub, who at first defended him wanted to cut him off. I wanted to give him one last chance however. So we kept him. Now here's the final straw. He starts to hangout with this group of boys we call \"roaches.\" They are loud, disrespectful, and just all around annoying. So now, Jerry's attracting the wrong people over here and we're all over it.

Last year a kid (whom I'll call Jerry) joined the class. For most of that year myself and my friends never really talked to him. Then eventually we felt bad because he didn't really have no other friends. So, we decide to kind of add Jerry to the group. He seems happy enough and things were going fine until I added him to our group chat. That's when all hell broke loose. First, we had to add him to a separate one because one of my friends (whom I'll call Kat) HATED him. Whenever Jerry and her were together she would just not be for it. So, after Jerry and Kat are separate group chats we realized that Jerry cannot take a joke for his life. So, we have to be literal with everything that we say (which is hard because we all are sarcastic). Once again, it wasn't much of a big deal until Jerry says one day (when for some reason he and Kat were in the same chat) \"Hey Kat I like your ass.\" We were all shocked because he was still new and stuff. Of course we all take offense to this because we've known Kat for longer and we thought he was serious. Then my other friend (we'll call Jub) starts trying to defend him until he says \"Jub I like your ass\" and \"I look at Jub and Kat ass.\" Yeah Jerry was kicked soon after. Jub tried to defend him but the rest of us agreed that he went way too far. Now fast forward to the next school year. Kat had left the school so now there's an open spot at our table for 4 (the rest of the group was spread throughout different classes). Jerry decides to take it. Here comes part two. We notice that Jerry tends to stare... In the wrong places. In a group of 80% girls this is a problem.

Today, I had plans with my boyfriend to get lunch and go swimming. I didn't plan on going with him in the first place, but when I mentioned it last night, he wanted to go too. Well, today, he laid in bed until he had work at 3pm. I spent the night at his place and at noon, I told him I was leaving for lunch soon if he still wanted to come. 30 min later, he hadn't moved and I was leaving. He told me to text him when I was ready to go swimming because he still wanted to do that. Well, I finished lunch and texted him that I was ready to go at around one. After getting no response, I told him I was leaving and he could meet me there. Halfway there, I got a call from him saying that he was gonna stay home because he was worried about being late for work in two hours. (Context: from his house to the pool is about a 15-20 minute walk and he works 5 min away from his house). So I went by myself. He asked if we could get dinner after he got off of work, but then at 7, informed me that he had to go to a meeting and asked me if I could wait. I told him I was hungry so if he wanted me to wait, he had to text me with a DEFINITE ending time for the meeting. (Our dining hall stops letting people in at 8:40pm.) At 8 I went to dinner by myself. No text or anything at all until he called me at 9:30 saying he was getting food from my favorite restaurant and offered to bring me some even though I already ate. Obviously, I accepted, figuring this was his way of apologizing, so I met him at his place and we ate at 10. Well, he talked to me for a few minutes and then went to go play overwatch with his friends. He asked if it was ok first since I usually play with him too, but I didn't have my laptop. Of course I said it was ok, but he played for 2 and a half hours. He is a loud talker, but when he has headphones in he fucking yells so loud. At one point I managed to fall asleep despite the noise and he literally woke me up, said nothing, and went straight back to playing his game. Eventually I told him I was gonna leave because we have class tomorrow, but he made me wait for his match to finish. Then took the longest goodbye.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR My boyfriend blew me off all day for some reasonable and some unreasonable things and I wanna know if I should be upset.\n(2) It wasn't sweet long, it was just him staring at me and standing in front of me so I couldn't leave.\n(3) I wouldn't be upset if he'd just said he was busy or at the very least stopped making plans that he would inevitably cancel last minute.\n(4) I'm getting more and more frustrated and I've mentioned it and he'll apologize, but nothing will change.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(4)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

I was not laid off, but it was made pretty clear that there was not going to be room to grow there so I started looking for a new job. Got a new offer within a month at a place about 45 minutes - 1 hour away for $25k more than I was making. During rush hour my commute was about 1h15m - 1h30m. I'd leave around 7am and get home around 6:30pm. &amp;#x200B; Our lease was ending in three months, and we had been planning on moving out already. I suggested moving somewhere in-between where we work and let her choose the place. So she found a place she thought she liked and we ended up moving there. It's about a 30 minute commute to work for me, and a 30-40 minute commute to work for her depending on traffic. &amp;#x200B; Now, for the hobby. She's part of a non-profit organization from our college that creates cat sanctuaries. She takes care of two cats that live outside her house from junior year. It's about 10 minutes from her work, but it's in the opposite direction. Her commute home, including feeding the cats (as in parking, going to the sanctuary and feeding the cats), is about 1h15m. &amp;#x200B; She hates it, understandably, because having a 1h15m commute sucks balls. But it's a hobby, there's other people in the organization that can help feed the cats, but she's adamant that she has to be the one to do it. She wants me to look for a new job so that we can move back to where we used to live. &amp;#x200B; In the first month, I said yeah we can do that once our lease is up, but I've actually grown to like my new job a lot. I'm a respected member of the team, the workload is pretty heavy but manageable, my boss is a great guy, and the money is good. I even got a 5k raise in my yearly review. I said we can try to move 15 minutes closer, but she says that's barely going to make a difference and we have to move all the way back. &amp;#x200B; I just think that's ridiculous. I get that she loves these cats, but I don't think she needs to be the one to feed them every day. I think it would be absolutely absurd to leave my job just so that she can be closer to the cats. She complains about it constantly and we keep getting in fights because I tell her she should just let someone else feed them during the week and that I wouldn't move anywhere that my commute would be longer than 45 minutes. &amp;#x200B; My latest suggestion has been that we wait for our lease to end and try to see if we can switch to monthly payments with no lease, then if I can find a new job that seems good we can move. She's not happy with that and wants to move as soon as the lease is up. We ended up getting into a fight about it where I said that living somewhere that our commutes to work are similar is more important than living close to her cats. &amp;#x200B; I get that it's important to her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) &amp;#x200B;\n(2) Hell, I even used to drive her there every weekend before she got a car, and helped pay for the food before she started taking food donations.\n(3) I actually think it's amazing what she does and how committed she is to them, but I just think it's ridiculous to base decisions about my career around these cats.\n(4) So, am I the asshole?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

But it's a hobby, there's other people in the organization that can help feed the cats, but she's adamant that she has to be the one to do it. She wants me to look for a new job so that we can move back to where we used to live. &amp;#x200B; In the first month, I said yeah we can do that once our lease is up, but I've actually grown to like my new job a lot. I'm a respected member of the team, the workload is pretty heavy but manageable, my boss is a great guy, and the money is good. I even got a 5k raise in my yearly review. I said we can try to move 15 minutes closer, but she says that's barely going to make a difference and we have to move all the way back. &amp;#x200B; I just think that's ridiculous. I get that she loves these cats, but I don't think she needs to be the one to feed them every day. I think it would be absolutely absurd to leave my job just so that she can be closer to the cats. She complains about it constantly and we keep getting in fights because I tell her she should just let someone else feed them during the week and that I wouldn't move anywhere that my commute would be longer than 45 minutes. &amp;#x200B; My latest suggestion has been that we wait for our lease to end and try to see if we can switch to monthly payments with no lease, then if I can find a new job that seems good we can move. She's not happy with that and wants to move as soon as the lease is up. We ended up getting into a fight about it where I said that living somewhere that our commutes to work are similar is more important than living close to her cats. &amp;#x200B; I get that it's important to her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) &amp;#x200B;\n(2) Hell, I even used to drive her there every weekend before she got a car, and helped pay for the food before she started taking food donations.\n(3) I actually think it's amazing what she does and how committed she is to them, but I just think it's ridiculous to base decisions about my career around these cats.\n(4) So, am I the asshole?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am sure \n3: I am unsure",

So ever since I started my period it has been incredibly irregular (I can go up to 5 months without one). This has been going on for a couple of years now and I contemplated getting out on the pill to try and regulate it but then I saw the side effects and was immediately put off. I did some googling and found this disorder that seemed to fit perfectly with my symptoms. I assumed that I had it for about a year before actually getting tested for it and being told that I didn't have it (this was back in September before I was dating this person). Fast forward to the present day and I've been in a relationship for just over four months now. We had a discussion about contraceptives and my s/o asked if I was on the pill. I said no and that I didn't want to be on it because of the side effects. They said they were okay to use condoms but would have preferred that I was on the pill as they really didn't want a child. I felt bad about the whole thing and stupidly decided to tell them that I had this disorder.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) In one sense I do have the main symptom that calls for a diagnosis of the disorder which is irregular periods but I didn't have issues with my ovaries visible via the ultrasound I had.\n(2) Considering all of this, AITA?\n(3) They were very supportive and said that it was completely fine that I didn't want to use contraception because it was already unlikely that I would get pregnant naturally.\n(4) So technically I am less fertile than most but I don't have the disorder that I told my s/o that I had.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(4)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

So I've been living in a 3 bedroom apartment with only 1 other roommate (both of us 23M) and when we moved in I got the \"master\" bedroom which was downstairs and he got one of the 2 smaller bedrooms upstairs. The master bedroom is only bigger by about a dozen or so square feet, so nothing dramatic. The only thing that really sets it apart is its downstairs away from the main living space and away from the 3rd empty room.

It was basic stuff to begin with like playing my emotions and belittling me, eventually escalating to him basically keeping me confined to my room. Most of my stresses started over the summer as it came out that I suffer from pretty extreme anxiety and had up until that point been majorly unaware of it. I'd had a stable life up until last summer when I was preparing to move to university 200 miles away from home. This was a huge deal to me and my ex was acting really off about it which stressed me out a lot. After I moved into my flat and started the term, he initially didn't give two shits until my best mate at the time forced me into doing some pretty fucked up stuff that I didn't want to do (using threats). After I told my bf, he got mad at me over it and come the start of this term, started to get mad at me for talking to certain people and was constantly monitoring my actions via social media, demanding my location.etc. This in turn led to me losing my social life and becoming permanently locked in my room out of fear for what he might say if I met a friend. It was also after this he began to suspect he had some serious mental health problems and was genuinely struggling with severe mood swings and was hurting himself/had thoughts of hurting himself. I blamed myself for this as it only really properly manifested after I told him about what had happened. It eventually resulted in him calling me to tell me he was going to drown himself in the river on my hometown. I was terrified and started worrying the house down in panic.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I promised him I'd always look after him and help him through the issues but recently my eyes were opened to him doing some fucked up stuff like, going through my phone when he came to stay and sending screenshots of private conversations to himself without me knowing (he kept them in a folder on his pc and sent them to others), having a go at me for talking to my family and for telling them the nasty stuff he said and how he'd isolated me from everyone here.\n(2) I still care about him and want to support him through getting help but I don't want to speak to him anymore because he keeps trying to manipulate me back into being with him again and he's angry at me for my choice so I feel like an asshole for both leaving him and for choosing to not support him when getting help for his mental health.\n(3) At this point I was so pissed I left him but I've heard that he's been struggling again recently and has/has considered seriously hurting himself after the breakup.\n(4) I had spoken to him on many occasions about his behaviour and kept forgiving him over and over but the stuff mentioned was the final straw.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(4)-(3)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

Boba Fett: One getting celebrated Han Solo: other one getting celebrated Mr T: Boba Fett's oldest friend Kodo: half of the wombocombo planning it all So 2 weeks ago Solo's gf and Kodo texted a bunch of people about how we were gonna go out and eat to celebrate Solo and Boba Fett (paying for them). They said it was either gonna be friday or saturday. That was all info given to us at the time. Since I didn't hear more of it I assumed it would be on saturday (bad planning on my part I know) and so I was gonna spend the friday after work at my gf. On wednesday I get told I can end work at 1 pm on friday (this never happens) so I tell the gf I can come over at 2 instead. Last night when me, Kodo and Mr T were in discord Kodo suddenly says we're going out on friday at 3 pm (that means somehow he and Solo's gf forgot I always end work at 4 pm) and that Mr T apparently hadn't been invited. Also we're going bowling at 8 pm. I get pissed at Kodo for not telling us sooner and forgetting to invite Boba Fett's oldest friend, meaning I gotta tell gf I'll come over at 9 pm instead.

I am still in high school, although it's homeschooling. I tell my manager I can't work Sundays and Thursdays. A few weeks ago I told him I can't work Tuesday/Wednesday (I allowed him to request which day due to my semi flexible schedule.) He chose Tuesday to have off. This week I look at the schedule (which changes every week, for some reason) and find that I am working both Tuesday AND Wednesday and only those 2 days. I text my manager and tell him early on Monday afternoon, right after I saw the schedule, that I can't come in on Tuesdays because that's a school day for me. He asks me to come in \"just for this week\" but I told him no. One, because I know if I say yes he will put me on the schedule for more than this week, that's how he is. Two, my school schedule is not flexible right now. I'm about to graduate and have lots of coding classes that I'm studying for and cannot afford to sacrifice time I set aside to reach my goals. It's important to note that I have school through summer, with small breaks in between. I know it would be much to ask to have many days off as he's used to having people on summer break, but there were at least 3 other employees out of school. All throughout summer he didn't cooperate with my schedule, having me work 4-5 days a week with ILLEGAL (somehow unknown to him) HOURS. Based on his track record of not trying to cooperate with my previous schedule, I don't really want to sacrifice more time than I have to to this job like I did during summer. It was a nightmare trying to balance school, family affairs and work, among other things.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I don't know if that's important to mention.\n(2) TL,DR: My manager puts me on days I requested off.\n(3) He cut my days last week without telling me and I never would've known had I not double checked when stopping by.\n(4) Kinda feel bad for calling out.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(2)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

When we had our first babies, we did everything together and were great support for each other. Her third child is still having naps during the day so sometimes it's best for us to hang out at her house. Which I dread. Her house is filthy. Not just 'I have three kids and haven't tidied up' kind of mess - way worse than that. Her couch is always sticky with some food stuffs and has crusted milk on the arms from gosh knows when. The floor is a mixture of sticky and crusty with crumbs, sand, food etc. They can't eat at the dining table because it's a mountain of washing and so the kids eat on the floor in the lounge room, making even more mess. Instead of cleaning the mess off the floor, she lets the dogs in to lick it all up. Which creates more mess because the dog hair is everywhere. One time I came around, her one year old looked like he had a beard from the amount of hair that was on his face. I cleaned it off and she just laughed, saying he always has a beard. The kids each have a separate room but their doors can't be fully opened because there is stuff everywhere. They have to stand on top of mountains of toys and clothes to get to their beds. The kitchen bin is always overflowing and the youngest is often found playing with overflowing rubbish that has fallen out the top. She has a supportive husband so she doesn't need to go to work, plus has a nanny come in two days a week to help out. Her parents also come around a couple of times a week to fold laundry and clear her dining table.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I like spending time with her and our kids get along great, but the filth just gets to me.\n(2) I really don't want to go around to her house and have started keeping track of her baby's nap times so I can suggest activities outside of the house.\n(3) I'm almost at the point of telling her I don't want to go over there any more.\n(4) She's in good mental health and is a wonderful mother, but I don't know whether she sees how bad her house is getting.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(1)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>",

There's an auto body shop roughly 3/4 mile from my work site, which is convenient as it's semi-close, however it's not reasonable to walk between there and my work site due to time constraints of a busy workday. The auto shop offers a shuttle service in one direction- from the shop to my work site. So once my brake job was complete, I would require transport from my work site to the auto shop. Normally, I'd do Uber. But my partner happened to have an off-day from work on the day that I was planning to get the auto work done, and he lives close to both my work site and the auto shop (we've been together 2+ years but do not yet live together). So my thinking was- when my car is ready, he can pick me up at work and drop me off at the auto shop. I notified him about 1 day in advance of this plan. He grunted some comment about not liking to have to do extra stuff on his day off, but he agreed. On the repair day, around 1pm I get word from the auto body that my car is ready. I call my partner to tell him to come get me. When he answered the phone, it was clear that I'd woken him from sleep. So I feel bad, but I told him \"look, the place is open till 5pm. Just finish your nap and then come pick me up once you're actually awake\". But no, he wanted to come do the drop at that moment, to get it over with. So he picked me up and then dropped me off at my car no problem. When he dropped me off at the auto shop, he told me he was going home to go back to bed. That evening he called me when he was awake. In conversation, he tells me it *really* messed up his day off to have to transport me to my car. He asserted that - as a floor nurse, he **needs** his days off for catching up on rest. I thought about it, and quickly stated that I didn't feel bad whatsoever; I've transported him to appointments in the past on my days off from work, and of course I would expect him to do the same for me. Then he gets more upset, claiming that I'm inconsiderate of his time off and his well-being. He even goes as far as telling me that I \"need to bring \\[him\\] dinner\" for the inconvenience that I caused him (I would have been fine to pick up some take-out for him in any case, but his sense of entitlement seemed undeserved and particularly annoyed me). I'm a bit floored by all this.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If this latter part is true, then maybe I should feel badly for assigning him this task on his day off.\n(2) He often (not just in this instance) talks about how on his days off, he just really needs to rest and recharge, claiming that' it's a nurse thing' that I wouldn't be able to understand.\n(3) I do have many concerns about how this behavior will affect our relationship when we live together, but before I even start thinking along those lines I first need to know - AITA?\n(4) In any serious relationship (we've been together 2+ years), I would expect any partner to accommodate such a simple request without making some big deal out of it.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(1)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>",

I thought about it, and quickly stated that I didn't feel bad whatsoever; I've transported him to appointments in the past on my days off from work, and of course I would expect him to do the same for me. Then he gets more upset, claiming that I'm inconsiderate of his time off and his well-being. He even goes as far as telling me that I \"need to bring \\[him\\] dinner\" for the inconvenience that I caused him (I would have been fine to pick up some take-out for him in any case, but his sense of entitlement seemed undeserved and particularly annoyed me). I'm a bit floored by all this.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If this latter part is true, then maybe I should feel badly for assigning him this task on his day off.\n(2) He often (not just in this instance) talks about how on his days off, he just really needs to rest and recharge, claiming that' it's a nurse thing' that I wouldn't be able to understand.\n(3) I do have many concerns about how this behavior will affect our relationship when we live together, but before I even start thinking along those lines I first need to know - AITA?\n(4) In any serious relationship (we've been together 2+ years), I would expect any partner to accommodate such a simple request without making some big deal out of it.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(1)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

We're both first years, so we don't have as much experience with campus life as as the average student. The position is one that basically involves J representing our faculty's voice (social sciences and humanities) at the student alliance level. For some reason, there are four positions for this yet only two people ran. I see J winning anyways as she is running uncontested. She won't stop talking about this election (signed me up to promote it for her without asking me, even forged my signature, constantly messaging me to post her promo stuff on social media). I'm worried I'm being an unsupportive asshole because I have been calling J out for her lack of campus life awareness. She doesn't know anything about basic issues pressing students. She didn't know about our student newspaper, our radio station that's shutting down, a referendum taking place during elections regarding bus passes, or a vigil for the Christchurch shooting that happened today.

Including myself. Since we're in UK, we can legally start drinking at age 18. My younger brother (20M) started at age 17 and spent the first two years of university really going hard at the drinking culture. When we would drive down to pick him up from university once every few weeks, he'd be really hungover, every single time - like a lifeless zombie. He drank pretty much every day, including day drinking pints of beer too. At the start of his 3rd year last September, he made the decision to completely quit drinking alcohol forever. He said he had enough of the hangovers and blackouts. Initially none of us in the family took him seriously, neither did his friends, but the weeks rolled by and we realized he was serious... Now it has been 6 months since he last drank, and I honestly think my family feels threatened...all of them keep trying to pressure him into having a drink, but he doesn't budge.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) After I had a heart to heart with him, he told me his drinking was really bad, and that his hangovers would last days even.\n(2) I then told him that I'm incredibly proud of him, and that he's inspired me to stop drinking too (1 week sober so far).\n(3) So my dad asks my why my brother hasn't drank and how he needs to \"lighten up\", I tell my dad that what my brother did is an incredibly brave thing to do at his age, and my dad tells me to shut up and calls me an asshole....he goes on to say that \"You're discrediting real brave people like soldiers and firemen when you use words like bravery so casually\".\n(4) My mum agreed him with too....I'm lost for words\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>0 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0<task3/>",

We had been talking for quite a while but realized we lived about 30 minutes away from each other, so we decided to start hanging out in real life. At first, I was happy to have someone outside of the internet that had the same taste in music as myself but the more I got to know her, I started noticing things. To start off about 98% of her friends were online friends. She literally had me and someone else who she actually hung out with in real life and I understood since I’m not exactly a pro at making friends but then it would get ridiculous. We would be having dinner together and these internet friends of hers would be blowing up her phone and she would stop talking to me to message them. In general, she never took her eyes off her screen and if she saw a notification from a group or person she liked she would drop everything and check her phone. To top it all off, because she was basically glued to her Facebook, she would post constantly about EVERYTHING. If her coffee was cold she’d post about it, if she had a headache she’d post, literally everything. One thing she would constantly do would be making these long posts about how much she loves her friends except I noticed she never mentioned me which normally wouldn’t bother me but since she claimed I was one of her closest friends and she was always posting about other friends I was a bit confused. After talking to her family and listening to things she’d share, I found out she had some mental difficulties, I’m talking ADHD, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and many many phobias so I tried to give her a pass, but things just got worse. On top of basically feeling like a babysitter, I then began having to remind her to take her meds and to make sure she ate, showered and did other things. It got to the point where I even offered for her stay at my place for a week over Christmas because apparently, she had issues with the family that was going to be at her place. That was a week I would never get back. I ended sleeping on an air mattress with her in my basement (with a night light and a pile of stuffed animals) since my single bed was too small for her and she was too afraid of the dark to sleep alone in the basement. She barely wanted to do anything with me and spent the week on her phone with these online friends even though I had a million things planned for us to do together. We went to a concert together and we spent two hours before the concert walking around the city looking for these people she had talked to in a group chat because “she wanted to talk to other fans of the group we were seeing” even though I was right there and loved that group and as much as I wanted to leave, I had no idea where I was in the city and was too terrified to get lost by myself. After the concert she told me she would pay me back for the ticket I had bought her since I wanted to make sure we were near each other and we agreed on a deadline for her to pay me back.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR -&gt; AITA for leaving someone who has been depending on me even though I clearly am not that important to them.\n(2) Basically, I realized that even though I had been there for her in real life and had done so much for her, these online friends of hers would always come first and clearly there is no room in her heart for me.\n(3) I told her I didn’t want to be her friend anymore and now I’m being bombarded with messages by all these people including her about how I’m being selfish and that she needs me and that I can’t just abandon someone in her situation.\n(4) Fast forward to now, I have received no money and she has been spending money on gifts (waaaaay above the amount she owes me) for these online friends of hers and on other concerts.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>5 <task2/> \n3: <task3>10<task3/>",

We’re now seniors in high school and for the past couple of years we’ve been playing video games with his dad we’ll call P (48M). P has always been a hard-ass but that’s his personality and stuff and I understand it. It’s his generation I believe and we still have a lot of fun playing video games together. So recently my friend K, had gotten his (ex) girlfriend pregnant, and this has put a lot of stress on him. We’re still in high school but he’s been missing school very frequently. Now last week, P had decided to punish him for missing school so much. Good, I was completely with P for this. Instead of doing the normal punishment, he is forcing K to play a with him, every time P gets on. So we were playing one day and K said he would rather have his entire PC taken so he could get his homework done and things and P said no this was his punishment. In my eyes, this is P forcing K to play a game with him, using the punishment as the way to do it. I feel like he’s being selfish, forcing K to play this game when he literally said he would rather do school related things. This had made K extremely mad and agitated constantly and obviously no one was having fun except for P. So yesterday I got a text from a girl he’s been talking to that we’re both good friends with, and she told me that he has been very depressed lately and had wanted me to know about it. He said he thought his father saw him as a disappointment and all that, and so I had decided to let P know because I figured he would at least care to let K know he didn’t see K as a disappointment. So today he messaged me back after I had said “Hey, I think you should lay off of K for a little bit. He’s just going back to being depressed apparently. Up to you but our friend said “K like he thinks his dad sees him as a disappointed, and he’s slacking school and he just feels different.” So P said “that’s life dude lol, sometimes you have to do what don’t want to that’s the point, he is being a disappointment” and I see where he’s coming from about that’s life. But I don’t think he’s trying to help K to NOT be a disappointment. He’s always been like this, where he doesn’t really get involved and he thinks he should be alone on this stuff. We kept arguing and I said “I was suggesting you deal with it so if you don’t want to then GTFO.”\n###List of Sentences\n(1) And he said that I had started the conversation so I said ”because I thought you cared” We argued more for some time after this and I ended the conversation with “Like dude, the only reason I told you this so you would lay off just a little bit.\n(2) You deserve whatever comes your way.\n(3) So he said GTFO out of what, and I had said this conversation.\n(4) I warned you”\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(2)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.0<task3/>",

So I had a big crush on this girl for over a year, let's call her Maria and him John. One day, after school, me and John were on our way to grab something to eat, when we randomly bumped into Maria and asked her if she wanted to come with us to eat, which she did. Once I was done, I had to leave as I had a Chemistry lesson, while both of them continued eating. (Mind you, I was a senior in High School and I was taking the exams in June). Fast forward to July, I was done with my exams and a female friend of mine told me that there were rumours that Maria and John went out on a date, and the first thing that came to my mind was that day I just mentioned. So I told her that the rumours are false and they never went on a date, they just simply ate for a bit together once I left the store. At the time, my friend knew very well that I had a crush on her and I was so sure that John would never do such a thing and I didn't even give it a second thought. The same friend that told me about the rumour, bumped into Maria one day and Maria asked my friend if she knew about the rumours, which it turned out to be true. So she told me, and then I asked a really close friend, both I's and John's, if he knew anything about the situation, let's call him Ted. So Ted told me that Maria and John had been talking to each other since last December and that they went on a date where they made out. When John told Ted that he had been talking with Maria and was planning a date, Ted told John that he had to tell me, which he did not want to do because ''it would had affected my exams preparation'' so Ted didn't tell me even thought he insisted. When I found out, I was lost. To this day, I really can't believe, that my best friend of 13 years would make out with my biggest crush behind my back without telling me literally nothing. It's not about Maria, fuck Maria I,now, couldn't care less, its all about honesty and being a decent fucking friend, let alone homie. Some of you may think: '' Oh come on man you would have done the same thing\" and I'll tell you something to show you how much friendship and honesty means to me. One night, I had a girl literally all over me, but she was an ex- girlfriend of a friend of mine, who is a really cool dude but we were far from close friends. So I said fuck it, Im not hooking up with her it's not right, at least according to my morals, so I was trying to kill time while she was all over me, until we left the club. If that was really about not trying to upset me during my preparation then he would have told me after I was done with them, right?\n###List of Sentences\n(1) To this day, he hasn't even said a simple '' I'm sorry''.\n(2) Well he had time but he did not.\n(3) I do not hold any grudges nor hard feelings, I simply don't want to have this kind of people around me.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

When John told Ted that he had been talking with Maria and was planning a date, Ted told John that he had to tell me, which he did not want to do because ''it would had affected my exams preparation'' so Ted didn't tell me even thought he insisted. When I found out, I was lost. To this day, I really can't believe, that my best friend of 13 years would make out with my biggest crush behind my back without telling me literally nothing. It's not about Maria, fuck Maria I,now, couldn't care less, its all about honesty and being a decent fucking friend, let alone homie. Some of you may think: '' Oh come on man you would have done the same thing\" and I'll tell you something to show you how much friendship and honesty means to me. One night, I had a girl literally all over me, but she was an ex- girlfriend of a friend of mine, who is a really cool dude but we were far from close friends. So I said fuck it, Im not hooking up with her it's not right, at least according to my morals, so I was trying to kill time while she was all over me, until we left the club. If that was really about not trying to upset me during my preparation then he would have told me after I was done with them, right?\n###List of Sentences\n(1) To this day, he hasn't even said a simple '' I'm sorry''.\n(2) Well he had time but he did not.\n(3) I do not hold any grudges nor hard feelings, I simply don't want to have this kind of people around me.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am sure \n3: I am sure",

I was aware he had drugs in the house. I learned after the fact that he also had a gun there, which he is legally not allowed to possess. I called to let him know I was on my way. He got irate and was ranting and cussing at me. I hung up on him and proceeded to show up with cops. Evidently this makes me the asshole? &amp;#x200B; So my ex is psychotic. In the last 8 (of a total 15) months, he has at various times threatened me, my friends, my cats and my infant daughter in an attempt to control/coerce me into giving him information that, to the best of my knowledge, does not even exist. I didn't realize I was going to hit \"Fuck it. Get out of my life.\" until the very moment it happened, and so had not properly prepared. Namely, I had left my cats at his house. Psycho has a lengthy arrest record and a tendency toward aggression and a complete lack of regard for other individuals. In the days following the breakup, our communications went something like: \"I want my cats back.\" \"Fuck you, They want to stay here.\" \"I'm coming to get them.\" \"They won't be here.\" until finally, verbatim, the message I sent was, \"Look. This is how this is going to work. I'm coming to get the cats. I'll call when I'm on my way so that you can have them ready. I'll bring the cops with me if I have to.\" When I was on my way, I called, and he started ranting a bunch of bullshit,\"Fuck you, you're not stepping one foot in my house. Don't even pull in the drive. I'm not giving you shit. You're not taking shit from here.\" So I hung up and called police - non-emergency - to have a cop on-hand in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of an altercation. Yesterday I found out he called my mother after the cops and I had left and lied through his teeth about me. I got pissy, and reiterated my desire to **not** see him in person. He responded by getting super upset because I brought the cops to his house when he had drugs and a gun there. (He's explicitly not allowed to be in possession of a firearm, as he has two gun-related felonies under his belt.) Apparently the existence of police in that situation warranted a response. He failed to factor in that my mother can't stand him, thinks he's a scumbag, and doesn't believe a word he says any other day of the week. (He's firmly convinced she adores him, which I think is mostly a testament to his delusional state of mind.) There's a whole bunch of shit I'm leaving out - the manipulation, the scare-tactics, the invasions of privacy and space and boundaries, not to mention the circumstances surrounding the aforementioned threats on the lives and safety of myself and those I care most for (which is why they were the people he threatened to harm, of course.) But I feel like once I get started, this post is going to steadily devolve into me just going on this long-winded diatribe about my asshole ex, and will thus detract from it's purpose which is to find out, was I actually wrong? Given his history and the fact that I told him I was going to do a thing I then proceeded to do, was I actually the asshole for showing up, police at the ready?

You don't bring cops to my door.\" mindset.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Am I wrong?\n(2) &amp;#x200B;\n(3) And honestly, I personally have a massive bias against police.\n(4) But they exist for a purpose, and while I don't really think breakup-mediation is typically something they should have to be called-upon for, I also feel like it was the least worst of a bunch of terrible options.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(4)-(1)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>",

Now, he meant EVERYONE. There are nearly 2000 student and staff here, and he bought real roses for about $1 each online. This seemed fine, until he went around asking for donations and admitted to me that he had to borrow money. And this was where I began to express my concern. I worried that this kid was going to get 2 Gs deep and not be able to do anything about it. He’s a senior almost on his way to college, from a less fortunate family. Now, I went about expressing my concern the wrong way, because I hadn’t fully thought out my words. I ended up saying, “He could’ve done something more beneficial with that money.

I got everything I wanted as a kid and it showed in my attitude. my mom being a stay at home mom got the worst of it because she was around all the time. Growing older and older however I started to ask for less and less. Because I wanted to feeling of achieving and getting something all by myself. I stopped asking for things at Christmas, my birthday, and holidays. Even though they would still get me things. My mom actually started to complain because she didn't know what I wanted because I never asked for anything. Also growing up I realized I was an introvert. So being in school all day wore me out. By the time I got home I was all socialed out and wanted to be held up in my room and in that presepctive I kept to myself. My mom's attitude towards me changed as I became more and more Independent. Some of her words because harsher and harsher. Then I started to think about how my mom would act during evening. She would constantly be on her computer. I'd try to talk to.her she wouldn't listen because she was playing a game on her computer. Even eating dinner.... She ignored us after we became teenagers, and then became angry at us when we would interrupt her wanting to tell her about out day. She started putting me in stress filled situations like putting me in between my dad and her in an argument and having me be the mediator. After a while of this obvious I acted out and eventually asked to go to a therapist.... She told me therapy is for weak people and then repeated it. Now I'm in my twenties moved out she live at least an hour away. And is still managing to upset me from that distance. Whenever we are in person it's a guilt trip about how she doesn't see me enough.

His parents are another story. His parents don’t like me, are mean and weird, and only really talk to me when they want me to pick up their younger children or dog sit. His mom has given me passive aggressive compliments and his dad is creepy and rude. They once told him to get out of their house at 21 if he’s going to have a video game in his room. His dad wouldn’t tell him his SSN to get off his phone bill so A could buy his own. His dad told the customer service lady but not his own son. Not my problem, I don’t interact with them much, he’s not too happy with them either. A has gone to boot camp and as such we don’t talk to him except through snail mail. My dad, who was in the same branch of the military, knows someone there who can tell us really tiny tidbits and they’re very few in between. Like “he just did x”, for example. Most people do not get this with their loved one. It’s very lucky and I’m sure some people would pay money to hear what’s going on with their kids or siblings at this time. I’ve been relaying the bits to his mom because we’ve been together so long I feel it’s just something I should do. I had a tentative date of his graduation. I texted her this info. My little brother just finished boot camp last year from the same branch, so I know the drill for it. I told her he’ll graduate this day, the tickets have to be picked up a day early, no exceptions. That night we might be able to take him to dinner. Keyword “might”. And then the rest of the weekend depends on all his stuff being processed and it’s not up to him. His date can change for any amount of reasons, especially if he fails something. I’ve been in an all military family for 20 years now. My dad was an instructor at the boot camp my boyfriend is at now. All my cousins go in. When their parents can’t fly up we’d go since we lived 20 minutes away. Graduation is something I’ve had to sit through a bunch of times, same thing each time. Well despite having my dad been an instructor there for 5 years, history of going for family, and being told it by someone working in that area and actively seeing him every few days, his mom starts in with an attitude. His parents always think they are in the right. They always think they’re better than others and know more. I told her all the info about graduation then she hits me with a “Well I’m going to ask his recruiter to get the CORRECT information”. His recruiter does not know anything about what’s going on.

I recently quit my God awful job as a dishwasher at a chain restaurant. I had only been there for a month, and I was already despising every day I had to be there. In the time I was there, two people had started and immediately quit, and another guy was fired because he just stopped showing up completely. I soon knew why. Management was a mess, and the dishwashers were treated like dirt. I referred a good friend of mine, and even he hated it when he was only a few weeks in. They were profiling him a lot, saying that since hes a big, tall dude, he can do everything without issue. We were both pretty out of shape and being on our feet for so long (without a break mind you) was destroying our bodies. I called in on a Friday telling them that I mentally and physically couldn't do the job anymore. There was no way I'd survive for another 2 weeks, and I sure as hell wouldnt ever work for them again. But they managed to convince the both of us to come in that day, then stuck us in the dish room alone on a packed Friday evening.

I recently quit my God awful job as a dishwasher at a chain restaurant. I had only been there for a month, and I was already despising every day I had to be there. In the time I was there, two people had started and immediately quit, and another guy was fired because he just stopped showing up completely. I soon knew why. Management was a mess, and the dishwashers were treated like dirt. I referred a good friend of mine, and even he hated it when he was only a few weeks in. They were profiling him a lot, saying that since hes a big, tall dude, he can do everything without issue. We were both pretty out of shape and being on our feet for so long (without a break mind you) was destroying our bodies. I called in on a Friday telling them that I mentally and physically couldn't do the job anymore. There was no way I'd survive for another 2 weeks, and I sure as hell wouldnt ever work for them again. But they managed to convince the both of us to come in that day, then stuck us in the dish room alone on a packed Friday evening. Now, we knew how to do our job, but we weren't experts, and you need at least 4 people on the weekends so that things dont get backed up...they knew we were the only ones back there and didnt even give us a heads up. We decided that enough was enough. We had been treated like such shit that day by both the cooks and servers.

The PROBLEM in our house is my younger sister. My sister is 14 and a freshman, and I’m 16 and a senior. It is safe to say that we do not have a good relationship, considering all that is happening. Her friends are trash, smoke weed, vape, drink harder than college kids, and are have just awful personalities. She’s turned in to a nasty kid, and has an awful attitude towards my parents and I. She’s failing classes, skipping school, not doing her homework, taking my clothes, stealing my mother’s makeup, etc. Obviously, some discipline has had to come into play, which has mostly just been taking the form of taking her phone or not allowing her out on weekends, which makes me absolutely livid. Most recent case in point was this past Saturday. Sister currently has her phone taken away, but has her friend’s old phone instead, which I have mentioned to my parents. Parents confronted her about it (not actually taking it because she denies having it) and she assumed I told them about it. So, to retaliate, she tells my parents he has video of my friends chugging wine at a party I attended and that my boyfriend and I have had sex on multiple occasions. a) the “wine bottles” were bottles of fucking sparkling grape juice and b) the boyfriend and I have never had sex for specific reasons which my parents are aware of. At this point she’s blatantly lying in order to get me in trouble and I am absolutely pissed. My parents and I sit down and have a conversation in response (basically reaffirming I didn’t do anything and she’s lying) and they tell me they’ll talk to her about it. I leave to go to breakfast with my boyfriend, pretty satisfied with how everything turned out until she fucking showed up in the SAME restaurant to go get breakfast with her friends. I’m pissed. I was always punished relatively harshly when I acted out (e.g. getting a C on a test and getting my phone taken away for a month in 8th grade), yet she gets to do all this other shit to make me miserable and to try and throw me under the bus and she still gets to go out and have fun with her friends. My parents didn’t even TRY to talk to her. Basically, I want to tell my parents that they need to shape the fuck up because this is bullshit that she isn’t getting punished for anything. My grandmother says it isn’t my place to say anything and that my parents already have a lot on their plate, but this is so fucking frustrating. They don’t do anything to discipline her. Just this morning I told her to take of my sweater and my dad just told me “leave it be.”\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Are you shitting me?\n(2) Fuck no I’m not going to leave it be, that’s my shit!!\n(3) So, WIBTA if I called out my parents for their lack of discipline?\n(4) I really don’t want to insult their parenting skills or anything, but this is too fucking much for me to handle.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>0 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0<task3/>",

The reason for this is poor communication between my wife and her mother. The bride is the daughter of my MIL's friend and coworker, and the two of them came up with this idea and think it's a great idea. When given the chance to say no, my wife did this thing where all she does is express her reservations without actually saying no. Therefore, my MIL ran with the idea. So by the time I found out about it, it was a done deal as far as the people in the wedding were concerned. This was months ago. Obviously, I could have said no, but it would have required a direct confrontation and cause tension between my wife and her mother. Part of me wanted to say no anyway. The whole situation makes me uncomfortable. I don't know anyone that would want strangers in their wedding, so I'm leery of these people that apparently do. I also feel like we're being taken advantage of. My daughters are essentially performing a modeling gig but receiving no compensation. In fact, we were expected to pay for their dresses (MIL took care of it). Lastly, and most or least importantly depending on whether you ask me or my wife, our alma mater is playing in a football game this weekend that I would only gladly miss for close friends and family. So, while I had plenty of reason to say no and would have been within my rights to do so when I first heard about all of this, I decided on balance, the best thing to do was to keep the peace. After all, it's only an hour on Friday night for the rehearsal and another couple of hours on a Saturday. Not that big of a deal. Cut to this Monday, with the wedding a mere 5 days away, we get an invitation in the mail. Come to find out, the wedding is an hour and a half away. This is going to take away our entire Friday night and all of Saturday afternoon.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) On the other, the poor communication is almost certainly not the bride's fault, and I feel like cancelling would cause her more stress than anyone.\n(2) Had I known this in the first place, I would have shut this whole thing down months ago.\n(3) So, WIBTA if, upon learning this new information, I cancelled the week of the wedding?\n(4) On one hand, it's obviously wrong that we're just finding out about this.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(4)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.5<task3/>",

But, can't a guy get a clothed, full length pic of the dude he's been dating for a year? Any time I want to bring it up, I feel like an asshole cause he's talked about how he hates his body. And any time I do try to pull at his seams he always starts crying and hangs up the phone... I love him so much but it's hard 'cause I dont even know what he looks like.

As in, can't stop coughing up a lung with body wracking coughs long enough to catch a breath, both types of asthma constriction kick in, and mucus glands kick into high gear, filling my lungs with fluid. It's an understatement to say that this is not fun, and something I desperately try to avoid. Boyfriend's closest friends tend to like the ganja when we have a gathering, and also know I'm highly allergic. They have watched me go through this more than once, watched my lips turn blue and debated on if an ambulance needed to be called (I always resist an ambulance call because there's literally nothing they can do besides give me pure O2 and rush me to an ER, where again, not much can be done that I'm already trying to do on my own with inhalers, caffeine, make-shift humidifiers, and an EpiPen in case shit gets that sideways), and yet they still smoke up in the same building as me, and just hope it doesn't carry to where I'm at. They regularly don't even take the effort to open a window or go outside. Boyfriend also likes the ganja on occasion, and usually tries to partake in ways that the smoke won't find it's way to me, though he has in the past partaken inside our apartment in his bathroom either when I was asleep, or at work, and felt this was not an issue because it was contained to his bathroom (which has the A/C control over his tub) and should dissapate before I'd come in contact with it. Recently we all met up for a celebration for my boyfriend, and again they broke out the green, went to a back room, and hot boxed it. I started to notice a small amount of the smell, and asked the host if we could do anything to keep the smoke to the back room, so the front door was opened. Then the partakers came back into the living room, with a cloud of smoke billowing with them, and immediately setting off my allergy. I barely saw the look of horror on my boyfriend's face as I dashed out the front door to collapse in a coughing/wheezing heap out front. Only my boyfriend came out to check on me. Everyone else continued laughing and partying inside while I sat outside fighting to breathe. When I finally could stop coughing and the wheezing minimized enough that I could catch a semi decent breath, I went back inside and collapsed on the couch from adrenaline rush and inhaled steroid shakes. No one said a damn thing to me or even asked if I was ok.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) The party just kept going.\n(2) FYI, we are not in a green legal state.\n(3) I really want to ask him to stop hanging out with them because obviously they neither care about me or respect the fact that my desire to keep breathing trumps their desire to enhance their party night.\n(4) On the way home, I asked my boyfriend to relay to his friends that it's not ok to smoke inside anymore if I'm going to be there, and preferably only partake through edibles or something else that is much less likely to set off my allergy, and he looked horrified that I'd ask that.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(4)-(3)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.5<task3/>",

No one said a damn thing to me or even asked if I was ok.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) The party just kept going.\n(2) FYI, we are not in a green legal state.\n(3) I really want to ask him to stop hanging out with them because obviously they neither care about me or respect the fact that my desire to keep breathing trumps their desire to enhance their party night.\n(4) On the way home, I asked my boyfriend to relay to his friends that it's not ok to smoke inside anymore if I'm going to be there, and preferably only partake through edibles or something else that is much less likely to set off my allergy, and he looked horrified that I'd ask that.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(4)-(3)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.5<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

Today we went on an excursion with a private guide (M40s, previously lived in Europe and 20 years experience as a guide). We are in a group of 11 people, and when we got out of the bus our group got separated while officers were asking for passports. Half of the group entered first with the guide and the other half was left behind (me included). We felt really uncomfortable and unsafe, since we felt that it's part of the guide's work to keep the group together. My parents and their friends are non confrontational people, but I felt that I should say something to the guy. Here comes the situation: I went to talk to him (its important to include that we are southern European and I was speaking with him in Spanish, whish isn't my first language nor the guide's). I don't know if I came off as rude but I basically told him that he should have waited for the whole group, because people felt unsafe and it was really non professional. I didn't insult him or anything, I know we southern European tend to be very passionate and when we are mad people can tell, but I didn't insult him or yelled like he did, I just explained to him why I didn't liked what he did. Then he started yelling at me, saying things like how he had to go purchase tickets or else we wouldn't get on time in the boat (he didn't warned beforehand) and then starts saying rude stuff like how I am the \"youngest in the group\" and stuff like that. He didn't apologized, what infuriated me the most was that he went to talk to my boyfriend (as if he needed to apologize to him lol). If he had explained rather than yell, I would be okay with that and everything would have been fine. The thing that is making me question if AITA or not is that everyone in my group turned against me and defended him (including my family and boyfriend, which didn't even heard what I said to the guy before, they weren't there, only heard him yelling), not even my parents stepped in (I know that I am an adult, but I feel if I was in their position I wouldn't let anyone scream to my kids that way). Needless to say that this ruined the trip for me and I just cried alone in the boat since I was so sad and so alone. I felt disrespected as a woman and a costumer. And like I am the \"bad sheep\". I know that this can be attributed to cultural differences, but the guy lives in Europe 8 months each year and is a guide for 20 years!\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He should have known better.\n(2) (English is not my first language either, sorry if there is any spelling mistakes)\n(3) So AITA reddit?\n(4) I can't even write this without crying reddit...\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(4)-(3)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.5<task3/>",

It was only a BJ, but he deeply regrets what happened and said he would never do it again. Everyone, including the “new” girl, knew about the exchange. Last night we went to one of our “new” friends houses. We got to know her after the past couple of months and we wanted to have a party. We get there, all four of my friends except me got super drunk, since they, including me, were lightweights. We get into her hot tub and almost immediately they get handsy with each other. Me and my sort of sober friend pulled them apart since we both know it would be a bad idea considering his history. My sorta sober friend then becomes drunk and starts to not care. I’ve sobered up throughout the experience since I had very little alcohol, and don’t like alcohol anyways. After multiple occasions of them sitting on each others laps and getting handsy, and me having to break them up and being called a cockblock, we get out. We start to watch a movie and they are sitting next to each other. I break it up and that’s that. After around 20 minutes I notice they aren’t in the room anymore. I go up to her room and they’re making out on her bed. I break it up, send him downstairs, and told her, “Really?”. I go back downstairs and told him that he’s a fucking idiot since it’s the same thing as last year.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He didn’t say anything and my now drunk friend from the hot tub told me to calm down and told me that I shouldn’t care.\n(2) I go to bed since I was done with the night, and woke up this morning.\n(3) Another detail I should add is that the girl in question thanked me throughout the night for me breaking them up when they got close.\n(4) I’m 90% sure they didn’t do anything else after that, but I just wanted to know, am I the asshole here?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>0 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0.0<task3/>",

FIL decides it’s the right time to take P out and ask him if he’s making the right choice marrying me EVEN THOUGH HE THOUGHT P WOULD PROPOSE EARLIER. Why would he ask AFTER we were engaged and not in the months leading up to it when he thought it was imminent 2) FIL decided to tell me that he didn’t like Indian food. Ok great my friend. Not a problem. I’m mixed race (Pakistani &amp; White), your White but the fact you don’t like Indian food *literally* does not bother me in any way. Everyone has preferences. BUT, to then go on and tell me it’s because you think Indian people (IM NOT EVEN INDIAN) because they are disgusting unhygienic people and Indian food is tainted by their “dirtyness” INFURIATES me. He then says, I can say that because your not Indian.(wtaf) 3) We were all going to go on a family holiday with P’s family. We all submitted dates that we would/wouldn’t be available. FIL decided to pick a date that only I’m not available. P tells him I’m not available. He says it won’t make a difference if I’m there or not 4) He deletes me on Facebook. Literally went to the effort to click on my profile and unfriend me, when I’m not even a part of his physical life. 5) Baby comes along. Asked him to not smoke if he wanted to hold the baby when we met. Blew his top off about smoking being an unproven risk and all the presents he brought the baby were now contaminated so wash them. 7) I don’t know if this is a “new mother thing”, but FIL never asks about new baby. The rest of his family annoy me with how much they spam me asking about the baby. His dad has never asked once about him. 6) Not really an issue but pissed me off. Announced to him the baby was born. He said oh is his last name Patel, he’s taking his mums name? I JUST DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POINT OF THAT WAS. Anyway, we have a family event and I’ve done my best to avoid him the last couple of years. I just can’t be bothered with it. He makes me feel uncomfortable and brings no value to me life. P goes sees him now and them end of. However, baby is now here. P wants baby to have relationship with FIL. Baby is breastfeeding, so has to be with me for a few more months. I don’t want to go to family event because I think his dad is an ignorant idiot. Also, he literally doesn’t even ask about the baby so it won’t make a difference if he’s there or not. Argument ensues. I don’t want to force baby to have relationship with FIL.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Do I stand my ground and not see him, meaning baby doesn’t see his granddad?\n(2) Do I just suck it up and go?\n(3) pls help internet strangers!\n(4) I don’t want to see him.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(1)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>",

Not a problem. I’m mixed race (Pakistani &amp; White), your White but the fact you don’t like Indian food *literally* does not bother me in any way. Everyone has preferences. BUT, to then go on and tell me it’s because you think Indian people (IM NOT EVEN INDIAN) because they are disgusting unhygienic people and Indian food is tainted by their “dirtyness” INFURIATES me. He then says, I can say that because your not Indian.(wtaf) 3) We were all going to go on a family holiday with P’s family. We all submitted dates that we would/wouldn’t be available. FIL decided to pick a date that only I’m not available. P tells him I’m not available. He says it won’t make a difference if I’m there or not 4) He deletes me on Facebook. Literally went to the effort to click on my profile and unfriend me, when I’m not even a part of his physical life. 5) Baby comes along. Asked him to not smoke if he wanted to hold the baby when we met. Blew his top off about smoking being an unproven risk and all the presents he brought the baby were now contaminated so wash them. 7) I don’t know if this is a “new mother thing”, but FIL never asks about new baby. The rest of his family annoy me with how much they spam me asking about the baby. His dad has never asked once about him. 6) Not really an issue but pissed me off. Announced to him the baby was born. He said oh is his last name Patel, he’s taking his mums name? I JUST DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POINT OF THAT WAS. Anyway, we have a family event and I’ve done my best to avoid him the last couple of years. I just can’t be bothered with it. He makes me feel uncomfortable and brings no value to me life. P goes sees him now and them end of. However, baby is now here. P wants baby to have relationship with FIL. Baby is breastfeeding, so has to be with me for a few more months. I don’t want to go to family event because I think his dad is an ignorant idiot. Also, he literally doesn’t even ask about the baby so it won’t make a difference if he’s there or not. Argument ensues. I don’t want to force baby to have relationship with FIL.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Do I stand my ground and not see him, meaning baby doesn’t see his granddad?\n(2) Do I just suck it up and go?\n(3) pls help internet strangers!\n(4) I don’t want to see him.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(1)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

My dad got fired from his longtime time about 3 years ago and my parents divorced last year. He hasn’t gotten a job since and is only making a little side money doing photography. He has never really been good with finances and that became apparent as I got older. He made pretty good money and he should have had built a really nice savings up but instead he has tens of thousands in credit card debt and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times in the past. I remember him always spending his money on random expensive things but still he should have plenty of money. He never bought clothes, drove an old car and he bought their house for 100K about 15 years ago. I honestly have no idea where his money has gone. I found out from my mom last week that he was really struggling and that he is putting his house on the market. He burrowed 2K from my mom and my uncle took out a personal loan to help him out over the past 3-4 months. I was shocked by this because 2 months ago he bought a BRAND-NEW living room set even though his old couch was perfectly fine. How can he burrow money and turn around and buy a living room set? Anyways, I knew that he would eventually ask me for money and today it finally happened. He came over and asked for $1,500 and that he would pay me back this week. He said he doesn’t have enough for his mortgage. I told him that I am not as well off as he thinks I am, which may or may not be true depending on your outlook. I own a business and things have been going really great this year and I have finally been able to save a good amount of money but this is my wife’s and I house fund that we’ve been working hard towards. I also told him I was hit with some unexpected bills (TRUE) and I couldn’t help him right now. He didn’t press me about it which was great. Technically yes, I can loan him money and not be hurting but seeing his spending problem worries me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) He made his own bed and he must lie in it.\n(2) The question is though, AITA?\n(3) Two other people have already loaned him money and he took that for granted.\n(4) He's refused to get a job, any job in the past 3 years and spent money he didn't have.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(4)-(1)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>",

When my sister and he started dating about 12 years ago he came on a family trip and got in the middle of a fight between my sister and me. After she struck me he put himself between her and me and being teenagers she continued to mock me behind his back. When I reached around him to push her he took my head and shoved me down into the bed I had been leaning on. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; Things had been okay until last year while on a family trip to the Grand Canyon. He and my sister are married and have an infant daughter at this point which makes siteseeing challenging. After seeing a few lookout spots over a couple hours we were all in a van together coming up on another lookout. My father was driving and he gets overly dramatic if he doesn’t get clear instructions on whether to stop so we just told him to stop. Everyone decided to get out except my BIL who said he was going to wait with the baby and shut his eyes. At the time my niece was sleeping so it seemed fine. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; My father and I took the longest to return to the car (30 min). When we got there I could tell that my BIL was in a bad mood but I didn’t know why. I guess the baby had started to cry not long after we left the car so he was left to calm her down by himself. We pile back into the car and get on our way. My mother starts doing this profuse apologizing thing that always gets my dad irritated but she was directing it at my BIL. She was apologizing for stopping at the lookout. Not knowing what had happened I tried to deescalate like I’m used to with my parents. I said “it’s fine, if someone doesn’t want to stop they’ll say they don’t want to stop.” Within seconds my BIL was cussing me out. I tried to explain that I didn’t mean anything by it but he wouldn’t accept it. Admittedly I did end up telling him that he’s been a grouchy jerk the whole time, but I had no malicious intent with the original comment. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to tonight, a year later on another family trip. We’re playing scattegories and he’s 20 points ahead of me and almost everyone else. Some of the answers are BS and I challenge a few regardless of who it is. I had a bad feeling that he was going to get mad because he’s competitive so I made sure to ask if anyone disagreed with my answers if they were a stretch. His answer for “Furniture” that start with F was “fan”, and “things associated with money” that start with H was “heap”. After challenging a few of his answers he freaked out on me again. &amp;#x200B; \\&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B;\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I adore my niece but I can’t stand acting friendly with him after he treats me so poorly.\n(2) So I’m cutting my trip short and leaving in the morning and don’t plan to participate in future trips with him.\n(3) I think I’m done coming on these trips.\n(4) My boyfriend would never treat my sister that way and if he did I would take issue with it.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(4)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

My birthday was a couple weeks ago and I was allowed to throw a party for the first time since I was 10. My parents put a 10 person limit on attendees; I thought it was fine since I don't have many friends anyway. However, while inviting my friend, Zafrin, a girl we'll call A heard and thought she had been invited. I didn't want to be rude, so I didn't correct her. I just simply told my parents that an extra person would come and they didn't seem to mind. Some background information, A is the richest girl I know and the most spoiled. Her house is double the size of mine and she buys 2 lunches everyday along with the one she packs. She also loves the fact that she is in higher math class than me despite me not wanting to go higher math class and having the grades to. One memorable quote is when I tried to help her on homework she looked confused on, she told me \"The math is a little too complicated for you, I doubt you'll get any answers right.\" I found out later I was right on most the questions. Despite her spoiled lifestyle, her mom won't let get her a dog for some reason, so when she met my dog, Tank (he is a black lab who is around 6 feet when he stands) she was excited. She immediately started calling him, \"my doggie\" which I was kinda annoyed with but wasn't vocal. I recall making a joke, \"You call him your dog when you pick up his vomit.\" When the other guest arrived we all decided to so bad karaoke ( singing off key to songs we found funny, it's really fun) A wasn't very pleased, she told us that the songs sucked, missing the point of the game. During Mine Diamonds, I realized she had finished her pizza besides her crust. I told her she give it to Tank because if she throws it a way he'll just dig through the trash. At first, she sticks her arm out horizontally making Tank see her. He starts to walk towards her and she then starts walking in circles, making sure he is following. I see this and tell her not to taunt him because he has arthritis and we don't like putting pressure on him for too long. She would do it again until I corrected her, once more and repeat. I thought on the 10th time she understood and stopped taunting him. However within a second she is standing on top of a chair and counting to taunt him. My dog jumps and starts to make yelps in pain. At this point, I was really upset and grabbed the crust from her hands and gave it to Tank.

So now I'm 21 and mystep father got drunk in the middle of the day for some reason and was being a bit of a dick. I don't like confrontations so I went to my bedroom to take a nap so my mother could get home and take control of the situation. An hour or so later he came down banging on my door and shouting from the other side. I asked him what was wrong and he just mumbled something about me being a cunt. So I went upstairs and asked him what was wrong. He just went around in circles about nonsense, he had obviously been drinking more since I went to bed. He became irate and I approached him because I was sick of yelling out to him across the living room. At this point he braced himself against the counter and dared me to \"try it\", I was confused because I had no intention of doing anything of the sort. I tried to explain this to him but he kept screaming in my face and after listening to it for too long I grabbed him by his shirt and told him that he's not my father, and to stop acting like he was. He then tried to pull away from me &amp; when I didn't let go, he turned and shoved me. He was stumbling because he was quite drunk so I tried to get him on the ground to stop him from falling and hitting his head on the counter or table or even falling on one of our dogs.

She then told me her partner was emotionally and a physically abusive to her. she showed me messages he sent, pictures of bruises, very troubling stuff. and I helped her break up with him. he know me enough to know my number and would call me and I would either ignore it or conjure some excuse. they got back together and she started ghosting again. for 4 days, she made no effort to communicate and kept her phone off. Finally she messagged me telling me that she told her boyfriend everything we said in private and that she was cutting me out of her life. To better their relationship then after I got angry, she ignored me only to message me a few days later saying that he read our messages and made her write that. we met in private because she didn't want to leave any cyber trail, and she told me she was going to get a restraining order on him and move back with her family. but he had stolen her money before she left. so I gave her $500 to go to her parents(they live on the other side of the country). However as soon as she leaves, I noticed the camera for work is gone. suddenly she blocked me on everything and my friend tells me that they were still together. I finally caved and told the newspaper what it happen and managed to keep my job, but I had to buy back the camera and it's expensive lenses. so now I'm down $2,000. People keep telling me that she saying I was lying to her and Incredibly controlling and blackmailed her into sexual stuff over her job and when she refused, I got her terminated. Those lies hurt more than anything. I lost several good friends because of this. That was a month ago. a few days ago a strange number kept calling me, I thought it was a robo caller until I noticed that they kept calling a lot more frequent. I answered the phone and it was her. she said she wanted to talk to me in private and I said no and hung up. and that brings us to Friday, I came home to find her in front of my house begging to talk to me. I told her I had nothing to say to her and that I know about all the lies. she tried countering and saying she was sorry and she wants me and her boyfriend in her life. that she knows he's abusive but he cares for her and is trying to get help for his temper. She tried to apologize as I tried to unlock my door. as I'm getting inside, she catches the door and attempts to get into the house and lost it. I started screaming at her to get out. after a bit to collect myself. I told her I'd had enough. I said something like \"you lied to me, stole money and a camera off me. I want you to remember how scared he made you feel the first time he punched you and you deserve it the next time it happens because you're still with him\", I slammed the door. she tried knocking a bit without saying anything and then she left. Haven't heard from her since I shouldn't have said that last part but I'm not going to apologize or say another thing to her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR: friend I work with tells me partner is abusive, lies to get money off me to leave him, steals my work camera, gets back with him, then attempts to come back into my life and I snap and tell her off in the worst way possible.\n(2) She's done so much to me in the past couple of months that that would just open another way for her to continue this cycle.\n(3) I do care for her but I tried to help and she stabbed me in the back.\n(4) She's cut contact with most of her friends, she doesn't talk to her parents and I've told them the basis of what's going on but won't go into detail.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(4)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>",

She then told me her partner was emotionally and a physically abusive to her. she showed me messages he sent, pictures of bruises, very troubling stuff. and I helped her break up with him. he know me enough to know my number and would call me and I would either ignore it or conjure some excuse. they got back together and she started ghosting again. for 4 days, she made no effort to communicate and kept her phone off. Finally she messagged me telling me that she told her boyfriend everything we said in private and that she was cutting me out of her life. To better their relationship then after I got angry, she ignored me only to message me a few days later saying that he read our messages and made her write that. we met in private because she didn't want to leave any cyber trail, and she told me she was going to get a restraining order on him and move back with her family. but he had stolen her money before she left. so I gave her $500 to go to her parents(they live on the other side of the country). However as soon as she leaves, I noticed the camera for work is gone. suddenly she blocked me on everything and my friend tells me that they were still together. I finally caved and told the newspaper what it happen and managed to keep my job, but I had to buy back the camera and it's expensive lenses. so now I'm down $2,000. People keep telling me that she saying I was lying to her and Incredibly controlling and blackmailed her into sexual stuff over her job and when she refused, I got her terminated. Those lies hurt more than anything. I lost several good friends because of this. That was a month ago. a few days ago a strange number kept calling me, I thought it was a robo caller until I noticed that they kept calling a lot more frequent. I answered the phone and it was her. she said she wanted to talk to me in private and I said no and hung up. and that brings us to Friday, I came home to find her in front of my house begging to talk to me. I told her I had nothing to say to her and that I know about all the lies. she tried countering and saying she was sorry and she wants me and her boyfriend in her life. that she knows he's abusive but he cares for her and is trying to get help for his temper. She tried to apologize as I tried to unlock my door. as I'm getting inside, she catches the door and attempts to get into the house and lost it. I started screaming at her to get out. after a bit to collect myself. I told her I'd had enough. I said something like \"you lied to me, stole money and a camera off me. I want you to remember how scared he made you feel the first time he punched you and you deserve it the next time it happens because you're still with him\", I slammed the door. she tried knocking a bit without saying anything and then she left. Haven't heard from her since I shouldn't have said that last part but I'm not going to apologize or say another thing to her.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR: friend I work with tells me partner is abusive, lies to get money off me to leave him, steals my work camera, gets back with him, then attempts to come back into my life and I snap and tell her off in the worst way possible.\n(2) She's done so much to me in the past couple of months that that would just open another way for her to continue this cycle.\n(3) I do care for her but I tried to help and she stabbed me in the back.\n(4) She's cut contact with most of her friends, she doesn't talk to her parents and I've told them the basis of what's going on but won't go into detail.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(4)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

A couple hours in and we've both had a lot of drinks. \"So you came alone?\" I told her this before early on. \"Yes ma'am.\" \"Not completely alone.\" At this point she forcefully grabs my crotch. I am shocked and sort of have a nervous laugh reaction which might have encouraged her as when i put my hand on her wrist to push her away gently she started \"groping\" me through my pants.

It first started by my step dad (which had been in my life for 2 yrs now) leaving without me knowing why.at the time my mom didn't tell me anything about it, I just got some vague idea by eavesdropping on conversations that they had a pretty bad fight... After that I got send into a mental hospital after my mom found my arms and legs full of cuts. But after that I had another mental breakdown because of my biological father. He died when I was only 6. And that really got into me because my mind just started saying how a bad child I am because I couldn't remember who my dad was, I couldn't even remember how he looks like, or how exactly he died... we got Into a family therapy to talk about it, my mom told the therapist, and me how exactly my father died, she told this story about how he saved us from a bunch of drunk man's and that if it wasn't for him I would've been raped... But the thing is, that's now what actually happened... and, at the time I believed it, even going as far as having memories of it, basically, my mom gave me a memory conformity about a trauma.... Of course I got really paranoid because although I couldn't remember what happend, I searched so munch on the Internet because I remember my babysitter telling me about how my dad was on the news... But after I learned the truth, I also learned another thing my mom didn't told me.... remember earlier how I talked about my step dad? Well the reason they got Into a fight/got a divorce is because he had a child fetish. Not saying he molested or did anything illegal, but he would watch porn with titles like \"daughter banging dad\" \"dad having sex with daughter\" and so on... and I didn't learn from my mom this info no no no... I learned from Joel's (my now new step dad) daugher, which in turn learned from my brother.... Basically she told everyone about it, exept me... And so after learning that, and after a second visit to the hospital, my mom told the truth about my biological dad, and how he was actually killed because he owned people money and he didn't have any... I was really mad by it, not by the fact of who my dad really was, but the fact that she lied to me while on a therapy visit, with emotions and everything.... I started hating her, doubting her, rebelling against her... I wouldn't talk to her, look at her, and even let her touch me... Her exude of not telling me/ drifting me away from the truth was that she wanted to protect me, she wanted to not let the outside world hurt me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) She was scared that I would be more depressed if I learned the truth...\n(2) I tried the best I could not to let my felling tower over the truth.\n(3) if you guys need any questions feel free to ask...\n(4) So my question is, was I in the wrong for being this rude to my mom?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(4)-(2)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

I didn’t notice him in the next room when I did it, and he threatened to cut me off financially and kick me out of the house if I did it again. I’m 17, almost 18. Context is that we were all preparing the house for a surprise party. My dad is notorious for saying that we should prepare weeks in advance, but he does everything last minute. Plus, he expects everyone else to do the work while he sits down and moves maybe one or two objects. Anyway, my dad was expecting the house to be immaculate. He wanted the doors scrubbed down, baseboards re-painted, windows washed, etc. I was already stressed, because my dad had given me three simultaneous tasks to do, and my mom called me to do yet another task.

I didn’t notice him in the next room when I did it, and he threatened to cut me off financially and kick me out of the house if I did it again. I’m 17, almost 18. Context is that we were all preparing the house for a surprise party. My dad is notorious for saying that we should prepare weeks in advance, but he does everything last minute. Plus, he expects everyone else to do the work while he sits down and moves maybe one or two objects. Anyway, my dad was expecting the house to be immaculate. He wanted the doors scrubbed down, baseboards re-painted, windows washed, etc. I was already stressed, because my dad had given me three simultaneous tasks to do, and my mom called me to do yet another task. We can’t say no to our parents. You only say yes sir/ma’am or you get punished. I was annoyed because I had so many jobs to do, and knowing I couldn’t tell my mom I was busy, or that I would get to her task later, I rolled my eyes in frustration. My dad caught me doing it, and he told me if I ever did that again, he would take all his financial support away from me and kick me out. I got intimidated and did what he asked of me.

I’m looking for an objective set of eyes on the situation. Also, sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile. We’ll refer to this person as Sam to keep genders/identities as hidden as possible. So, I’ve had a problem with Sam, but I can’t remove him/her from my life because he/she is my SO’s cousin, and they’ve been close since birth. The story begins here: when my SO and I began our relationship, Sam was jealous that SO was in a relationship and he/she wasn’t, so he/she badmouthed me to my SO all of the time. Sam turned out to be so effective at turning my SO against me that we ended up breaking up for about a year. Then, during junior year prom (I’m a whiny teen, as it turns out), Sam was again jealous because the person that he/she wanted to go with went with someone else, and was in a general bad mood. My SO and I were talking again, and as I tried to make my way over to SO to dance, Sam got in my way over and over so I couldn’t. Then, another person went and danced with my SO. I was upset the rest of the night. However, since then, I’ve reconnected with my SO and we have been dating for a while, and Sam has found him/herself a SO. Thus, I’ve had to spend most of this year of school around Sam+SO. This exposure has lead to nothing but constant roast sessions between myself and Sam; Sam will call me scrawny while I will rip on Sam for the stupid things that he/she says. This all culminates in the study session in the library today. Sam had been laughing at me for something that he/she wouldn’t even tell me about, and I was quite annoyed about it. So, my asshole move reared its head. I took a book about fitness off of the shelf and told Sam that he/she should read through it. Keep in mind, Sam certainly isn’t a fat or anything like that, Sam is just slightly on the larger side. Major dick move, I get it. Then, as I was trying to fall asleep Sam’s SO decides to text me, demonstrating how upset he/she is, lambasting my morals, threatening to kick my ass, and demanding an apology. I apologized for what I said, but the entire conversation was tinged by the impression that Sam’s SO believes that he/she did nothing wrong and I was the criminal, which I couldn’t take.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Sam has no right at all to assume that it’s okay to make fun of my scrawniness, and shouldn’t be surprised when he/she gets a taste of his/her own medicine.\n(2) I believe that if Sam would insult me about my body (being scrawny), Sam should be able to take an insult about his/hers.\n(3) I get it, Sam is probably self-conscious about his/her body, but I just can’t understand how someone could think that my insult was completely unprompted and “over the line”.\n(4) So the question is, am I the only asshole in this situation, are we both, or are we just a bunch of whiny teenagers still trying to figure out life?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.0<task3/>",

I ended up replacing the battery but my mom had bought me a new 2DS already. My friend, who didn’t have any Nintendo game consoles except for the Wii, expressed interest in the old 2DS. I agreed, as at the time we were pretty close, considering each other best friends. Along with the 2DS I gave him some Pokémon games that he’d always expressed interest in. This included: Pearl, White, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Moon. Each of these games roughly cost $40 for me to buy. I cherish each of these but felt that I could do without them since I had either beaten them or had the alternate versions of each copy (For non-Pokémon nerds, most Pokémon games get sold in pairs with the two games virtually the same besides minor differences) Fast forward to earlier this week. I made some meme about one of the Pokémon you can encounter in the games. My friend responded, very confused, and wondered what the heck the Pokémon was. It was a fairly common and recognizable Pokémon creature so I was kinda confused. I grew suspicious and hated asking him so, but questioned him in a joking manner “Have you ever even actually played the games?” He flat out said no, and included that he doesn’t know where the 2DS went. I’m glad he responded honestly, but part of me felt very betrayed. One could use the excuse that he’s just busy and hasn’t gotten around to them, but he’s consistently Online, playing some sort of Xbox game. I was furious, as I had spent a lot of money on these games. I asked him for the games back if he never was gonna play them, as I wanted my money’s worth and my games back. He kinda just responded half-heartedly, not caring.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I know a gift is a gift and that it would be terrible to take it from him, but it also upsets me that he never used it or thought about doing so.\n(2) Am I the asshole for asking for the games back?\n(3) I haven’t heard back from him since and probably won’t unless I bring the conversation back up.\n(4) I also don’t wanna tarnish our friendship over something as stupid as a video game.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(4)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.5<task3/>",

I ended up replacing the battery but my mom had bought me a new 2DS already. My friend, who didn’t have any Nintendo game consoles except for the Wii, expressed interest in the old 2DS. I agreed, as at the time we were pretty close, considering each other best friends. Along with the 2DS I gave him some Pokémon games that he’d always expressed interest in. This included: Pearl, White, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Moon. Each of these games roughly cost $40 for me to buy. I cherish each of these but felt that I could do without them since I had either beaten them or had the alternate versions of each copy (For non-Pokémon nerds, most Pokémon games get sold in pairs with the two games virtually the same besides minor differences) Fast forward to earlier this week. I made some meme about one of the Pokémon you can encounter in the games. My friend responded, very confused, and wondered what the heck the Pokémon was. It was a fairly common and recognizable Pokémon creature so I was kinda confused. I grew suspicious and hated asking him so, but questioned him in a joking manner “Have you ever even actually played the games?” He flat out said no, and included that he doesn’t know where the 2DS went. I’m glad he responded honestly, but part of me felt very betrayed. One could use the excuse that he’s just busy and hasn’t gotten around to them, but he’s consistently Online, playing some sort of Xbox game. I was furious, as I had spent a lot of money on these games. I asked him for the games back if he never was gonna play them, as I wanted my money’s worth and my games back. He kinda just responded half-heartedly, not caring.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I know a gift is a gift and that it would be terrible to take it from him, but it also upsets me that he never used it or thought about doing so.\n(2) Am I the asshole for asking for the games back?\n(3) I haven’t heard back from him since and probably won’t unless I bring the conversation back up.\n(4) I also don’t wanna tarnish our friendship over something as stupid as a video game.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(4)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.5<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

Sorry for the wall of text, backstory is needed. So like the title says, my father and I got into a huge fight a couple months back. Things have always been rocky between us ever since I was around 11 or 12, because he’s always had terrible anger issues and I started dealing with depression and anxiety at a young age because of it. I started letting my grades slip and started not wanting to do any kind of work in school and at that point my father thought that I was a complete failure and would be no more than a \"lying, conniving fox\". Thing is, because of his anger, I would lie and hide things from him. Wouldn't any normal child do the same? Knowing that your parent would go off on you. Things got worse and worse to the point that he started beating me. I remember very vividly one time he grabbed me by my hair, was dragging me around the floor and threw me against the wall. Fast forward to fight. My dad had gotten mad when he picked up my daughter from pre-k and thought he saw my ex's name on the box where it's signed who dropped her off in the morning. (Whole other story, but he's not a good person and it's why he's an ex now) I know for a fact that I dropped her off. He insisted he saw another name. I started getting upset because I KNEW I was innocent, and started yelling at him and letting out how he doesn't trust me from back then and that I have issues because of it, and that I would be seeing a therapist soon because of him. He yelled back at me and was saying \"bullshit, there's nothing wrong with you. A therapist won't tell you crap\" at this point I'm fuming and am so upset I'm bawling, and start telling my daughter to get in the car and we're leaving. My dad then says \"don't you take it out on her, she didn't do anything wrong\" to which I said \"why? You beat me whenever you were mad at me. She's my daughter, I can discipline her the way I want\" (I would never treat her the way he did, I was just so angry) and he said \"because you deserved it. You did that shit on your own. You lay a hand on her, I'll call CPS, same way you did on me\" (I did call once cause I was bleeding and bruised so bad, but they never did anything) at this point I don't even say anything and leave. The last text I have from him after that fight was Jan. 10. I haven't not spoken to him since, have not seen him and don't go around him anymore. When I did see my therapist, I told her everything that happened with my father and how it has affected me in that I am terrified of confrontation and someone being upset or mad with me. She ended up diagnosing me with PTSD, anxiety and severe depression.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I ended up getting a service dog and she's been wonderful, but now I'm starting to doubt myself.\n(2) So Reddit, AITA?\n(3) I told my sister who told my mom, who I know told my dad.\n(4) But he still hasn't said anything to me.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(4)-(1)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>",

The waitress brings my tea out and I’m still looking over the menu. A few minutes later I order a salad and some brisket tacos. I wait sipping my tea. After about 20 minutes my waitress comes by and says your food should be out shortly. I then ask if it is customary for my salad to come before the tacos? I didn’t want to be in the middle of eating a salad and then my hot tacos come and sit there getting cold. She then said oh let me check the kitchen. She came back after about 10 minutes with my salad and said yea the guys in the kitchen are new so I put a fire under them and they got your salad done. It had a little tiny container of ranch dressing with it. She asked me if the dressing was enough and I asked to please get a little more. She said no problem. She disappeared again and I finished most of my salad but not all of it due to not enough dressing. By this time my drink is almost gone and she arrives with my tacos. She then disappears again and my drink is empty. As I eat I start looking around for her because I am thirsty. I see her to my left across the room sitting at a high top table talking to a lady. I keep eating but also keep looking her direction hoping to catch her eye. I never catch her eye and she never looks my way. I finish my food and am now annoyed because I really wanted more tea. She is still over at the table talking to the girl. Another waitress comes walking by and I ask her if she can tell my waitress “who is just sitting over there talking” that I would like my bill? She said yes. Finally my waitress comes and she said here’s your bill. Sorry I was training a new girl. But she said I kept an eye on you to see if you made any indication of needing anything.

Because we’ve never seen eye to eye, I can’t tell when I’m over reacting because my baggage with him or he’s just being a dick. Originally for my upcoming birthday we were going to visit my brother across the country (we were going to go last year but I got myself a new job I couldn’t take time off).. I was hesitant for reasons but at Christmas I said let’s do it! He decided the buying the paint would be my gift (I asked him in November just to help me do the project) and we’d hopefully go on the trip next year when I’m in a better place. Myself, not him) Multiple times I tried to get him to help me find a particular shelf for all my books, he’s always interested and even said at one point “we’ll take care of it don’t worry!” He hasn’t helped me at all and has no intentions of helping me with my shelving situation. This project has been dragged on so after two weeks, the weekend to paint was here!!! Turns out there was a 15% sale on paint Monday to Wednesday so no painting that weekend (my dad has more than enough money but it is good to be frugal I do see that, we just had planned for that weekend to paint then plans changed) We have two doors that me and my roommate would love to replace and I mentioned it if he could pick them up during the sale(and we’d pay or course), he said they wouldn’t fit in his car, I’m not sure why, I don’t press when he makes excuses. My landlord requested a certain brand of paint, he said it wasn’t a problem. Didn’t get the right paint cause “he won’t notice” Obviously I knew he wouldn’t come by on Sunday for the VERY last visit (yay!) because Super Bowl but he did his stupid game of saying “oh maybe I will, it would make more sense” but of course he didn’t. So now pushing project 3 weeks and one day, oh well, one more day won’t kill me plus it is super bowl. For some reason when he came today, he didn’t paint my door, or put the doorknob back on that I took off. He thought we would just paint it on Wednesday. So he left my door knob-less and expects me to wait until Wednesday now. Am I the asshole? Expecting too much?\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If you read all this I appreciate you very much, I’m having difficulty expressing myself right now.\n(2) Am I crazy?\n(3) Keep in mind, my relationship is strained as it is, so being around him and having my house chaotic for 3 weeks could easily be skewing my judgement.\n(4) Am I spoiled?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(4)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>",

Because we’ve never seen eye to eye, I can’t tell when I’m over reacting because my baggage with him or he’s just being a dick. Originally for my upcoming birthday we were going to visit my brother across the country (we were going to go last year but I got myself a new job I couldn’t take time off).. I was hesitant for reasons but at Christmas I said let’s do it! He decided the buying the paint would be my gift (I asked him in November just to help me do the project) and we’d hopefully go on the trip next year when I’m in a better place. Myself, not him) Multiple times I tried to get him to help me find a particular shelf for all my books, he’s always interested and even said at one point “we’ll take care of it don’t worry!” He hasn’t helped me at all and has no intentions of helping me with my shelving situation. This project has been dragged on so after two weeks, the weekend to paint was here!!! Turns out there was a 15% sale on paint Monday to Wednesday so no painting that weekend (my dad has more than enough money but it is good to be frugal I do see that, we just had planned for that weekend to paint then plans changed) We have two doors that me and my roommate would love to replace and I mentioned it if he could pick them up during the sale(and we’d pay or course), he said they wouldn’t fit in his car, I’m not sure why, I don’t press when he makes excuses. My landlord requested a certain brand of paint, he said it wasn’t a problem. Didn’t get the right paint cause “he won’t notice” Obviously I knew he wouldn’t come by on Sunday for the VERY last visit (yay!) because Super Bowl but he did his stupid game of saying “oh maybe I will, it would make more sense” but of course he didn’t. So now pushing project 3 weeks and one day, oh well, one more day won’t kill me plus it is super bowl. For some reason when he came today, he didn’t paint my door, or put the doorknob back on that I took off. He thought we would just paint it on Wednesday. So he left my door knob-less and expects me to wait until Wednesday now. Am I the asshole? Expecting too much?\n###List of Sentences\n(1) If you read all this I appreciate you very much, I’m having difficulty expressing myself right now.\n(2) Am I crazy?\n(3) Keep in mind, my relationship is strained as it is, so being around him and having my house chaotic for 3 weeks could easily be skewing my judgement.\n(4) Am I spoiled?\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(4)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

Her work station is in the same room as my computer, and I really don’t want to breathe the fumes in because they’re literally toxic and just not pleasant to breathe in. I would move, but my computer is a desktop and I would have to lug the entire thing (including the desk) into my room. I’m considering doing that, but I don’t want to be chased out of “my area” and holed up in my room all day (I use the computer for everything). She’s already taken over another room in our house which I have no problem with, but I’d wish she’d use that room or her bedroom to paint. I asked her if she could paint somewhere else, but she said she could only paint there (despite having a desk in her room). She said she’d open the windows, but it still smells really strong when she paints. The entire upstairs smells like nail polish now (the room I’m talking about is an open room) even with the fan on. The fan is pretty small though, and only one window is open, so after I’m done posting this I’ll open up more windows and turn on our other fans. But I want to ask her to move again, because I don’t think it’s fair of her to chase me out of my area when the fumes are harmful and she has other options. WIBTA for trying to force her to move? btw, I’m 17 and she’s 18, and we live with our parents.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I can’t really move and the polish is stinking up the entire second floor.\n(2) WIBTA for forcing her to move?\n(3) tl;dr: sister is painting with toxic nail polish near me and won’t move.\n(4) A couple of months ago she used a super strong toxic glue to make something, and when I asked her to do it somewhere else she blew up on me, so I’m hesitant to start another fight if I’m in the wrong.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(3)-(1)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>5 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.5<task3/>",

I knew Caroline “studied” in Germany for 3 weeks during summer while she was 15. We arrive in Germany and she says she’s reconnected with a friend, named Jack, from when she studied there and she asked if I’d be up to meet him. I said sure. Jack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack’s friends, Paul. She’s so into Paul that she’s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. For the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn’t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. I’ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. The next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc. Apparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if “he still felt anything” AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I refused to apologize, I told her I’d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n(2) It’s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she’s still demanding I apologize for being a “slutty bitch” and “ruining the trip.”\n(3) I see no reason to, but she’s being so insistent I’m starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong.\n(4) AITA for sleeping with Jack?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>0 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0.0<task3/>",

I'm one of the few who switches between morning and night shifts, as I'm trained for both routines. There's not a lot of people who work in the department, probably around 10 total. Because of this, usually someone will work until a certain time and then someone else comes in to take that person's place. Now, I have this one coworker I'll refer to as \\[REDACTED\\]. \\[REDACTED\\] is always late. That's not an exaggeration. He runs from 15-30 minutes late. I'm not sure why. I would think if there's a problem that causes him to be late he would had fixed it by now so I'm just assuming he doesn't care. The only reason why he isn't fired yet is because he's one of the 3 people who knows how to close down the department fully and does it the best. Anyways, this Sunday I was working a whopping 11 hour shift from 5am-4pm because a good amount of staff are college students and are taking spring break off to go back home/see family/ect. I wasn't super excited because that's 10 1/2 hours on my feet (only get one 30 minute break) and my longest shift I've ever worked in any of my jobs. I also have bad insomnia so a opening shift means probably 4 hours of sleep for me. As the end of my shift was (thankfully) approaching, I ran over to the schedule to see who was taking over for me. It's \\[REDACTED\\]. A bit later it gets to 4pm (the time I was scheduled to leave) and to no one's surprise, \\[REDACTED\\]'s no where in sight. At this point my feet feel like they're withering away from the pain of being on my feet since 5 that morning and I'm seriously debating cutting off my feet as I'm sure that would hurt less than the state of my feet in that moment. At roughly 4:20 (hehehehe) and STILL no sign of \\[REDACTED\\], I go over to one of my coworkers and say \"Fuck this, I'm leaving\". He starts to say something but I speedwalk toward the terminal and clock out, grab my jacket and backpack, and book it out of there, too emotionally and psychically exhausted to deal with anyone else. 2 days later I come back into work and my coworker I talked to before practically running out of there was working. He comes up to me and basically says what I did was a dick move and I need to wait for \\[REDACTED\\] or whoever's coming to replace me before leaving. I argued that I would normally wait but 1) I worked a 11 hour shift that day and 2) \\[REDACTED\\] is always late, and, to be frank, that's not my problem. He didn't have a comeback after that but was still pretty rude and blunt to me the rest of the shift, as well as another one of my coworkers who saw me rush out of there.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) But Reddit, AITA??\n(2) &amp;#x200B;\n(3) Since then I've been probably overthinking this and feel pretty guilty.\n(4) &amp;#x200B;\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

I knew since the beggining or our relationship that she is attracted to girls, which I didn’t really mind, because it has never previously been an issue for me. To give this story some background, she was on anti-depressants for almost a year (she stopped taking them recently) and they fucked her up a bit, they have some horrible side-effects and affect your behavior. I didn’t care much because I was willing to help, I knew she needed someone to support and take care of her. Now, for the actual story... She started uni again this year and she made some friends. She also met this girl (we’ll call her Sara) which is a year ahead of her. Sara is a lesbian, she dresses like a guy and that’s pretty much all her Facebook profile shows. A few months ago my girlfriend and Sara went out to talk about uni and other stuff. My girlfriend told me parts of the discussion they had, which involved Sara encouraging my girlfriend to try MDMA, because it’s cool and similar stuff. Knowing this person could be a bad influence on my girlfriend (as she was on antidepressants, which means not even alcohol is allowed), I told her it doesn’t sound like a good idea for them to hang out too much, but she didn’t listen to me. Time passed by and I realized I was right. Sara was some kind of female fuckboy by what my girlfriend was telling me. I asked her why won’t they stop talking, which resulted in girlfriend telling me she has a crush on her. I felt pretty weird, I didn’t know how to react.. I felt jealousy and I talked with my girlfriend about this but she told me I shouldn’t worry. After some time, I think they got in an argument or something and they stopped talking. Honestly, I was happy.. Girlfriend came to me and promised she’ll listen to me from now on, told me I was right and that she won’t talk to her anymore.. Not much after, she started acting weird. She didn’t want to tell me what’s wrong at first but after a few tries, she told me she really likes Sara and that Sara broke her heart. That made me feel useless. I felt betrayed.. I felt broken as well. My girlfriend and I had all the reasons to be happy but she’s sad over some hoe.

I knew since the beggining or our relationship that she is attracted to girls, which I didn’t really mind, because it has never previously been an issue for me. To give this story some background, she was on anti-depressants for almost a year (she stopped taking them recently) and they fucked her up a bit, they have some horrible side-effects and affect your behavior. I didn’t care much because I was willing to help, I knew she needed someone to support and take care of her. Now, for the actual story... She started uni again this year and she made some friends. She also met this girl (we’ll call her Sara) which is a year ahead of her. Sara is a lesbian, she dresses like a guy and that’s pretty much all her Facebook profile shows. A few months ago my girlfriend and Sara went out to talk about uni and other stuff. My girlfriend told me parts of the discussion they had, which involved Sara encouraging my girlfriend to try MDMA, because it’s cool and similar stuff. Knowing this person could be a bad influence on my girlfriend (as she was on antidepressants, which means not even alcohol is allowed), I told her it doesn’t sound like a good idea for them to hang out too much, but she didn’t listen to me. Time passed by and I realized I was right. Sara was some kind of female fuckboy by what my girlfriend was telling me. I asked her why won’t they stop talking, which resulted in girlfriend telling me she has a crush on her. I felt pretty weird, I didn’t know how to react.. I felt jealousy and I talked with my girlfriend about this but she told me I shouldn’t worry. After some time, I think they got in an argument or something and they stopped talking. Honestly, I was happy.. Girlfriend came to me and promised she’ll listen to me from now on, told me I was right and that she won’t talk to her anymore.. Not much after, she started acting weird. She didn’t want to tell me what’s wrong at first but after a few tries, she told me she really likes Sara and that Sara broke her heart. That made me feel useless. I felt betrayed.. I felt broken as well. My girlfriend and I had all the reasons to be happy but she’s sad over some hoe. Recently, I saw they were talking again so I confronted her and asked her why would she do that. She told me she feels like talking to Sara. I have to admit I got pretty upset and felt jealous because last time she was feeling sad over some bitch and I didn’t want that to happen again. I asked her if that girl means more to her than me. She said no, and I asked her why would she do that after she got hurt by that person and I got a typical response that sounded like ‘I wanna see where this goes’.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) AITA? what should I do?\n(2) A few weeks later, here I am again, they started talking again and my girlfriend even told her to go out.\n(3) I told her I don’t want them to talk anymore but she says “it’s a girl, it’s not the same thing”.\n(4) I told her she has no respect for me as she knew it hurt me last time to see her suffer over Sara and I told her to choose between me and her, and they stopped talking.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>5 <task2/> \n3: <task3>10<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

My BIL and SIL have a 6-month-old \\[the first grandchild\\] and have been together for 3 years. BIL + SIL moved close to us and his mom still lives where we're all originally from. My MIL has always shown a preference for my SIL ever since her and my BiL got married - which tbh, my SIL is amazing, and a great person. I love her too. MIL and I have a decent relationship overall, and communicate regularly. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, when my SIL was pregnant with niece my MIL was enamored. Everyday asking how SIL was feeling throughout her pregnancy, sending her pregnancy gifts, sending boxes upon boxes of gifts for baby \\[which went against SIL wishes, as she told everyone to not buy any gifts until after the baby was born as they do back where she's from, but that's another story.\\] My MIL always wanted belly pictures and cried when they first initially told her they were pregnant. I know all this because we share a group chat in a chat app, and have for years. We also saw her reaction to the baby announcement because they taped it - it was honestly very sweet. &amp;#x200B; So, husband and I finally get pregnant \\[we had some trouble\\] and I'm excited to move into this new chapter with MIL - but that hasn't been the case. When we announced our pregnancy to her, her reaction was \"You waited this long to tell me?\" \\[Note: We told her within the same week she was told about my niece - 13 weeks\\]. That's the video my partner and I have to look back on. I have received 0 pregnancy gifts, and when she came out to visit us she brought my niece a box of gifts, and brought us 2 onesies - which I tried really hard to be as appreciative as possible for. Throughout the visit, she didn't ask me once how I was feeling, and only asked to touch my belly after my husband asked her multiple times to feel our baby move. \\[This was her final day on a weeklong trip\\]. I also try to send her weekly updates on his size, and I get a smile emoji back -- god this sounds so petty, but if you see how she responds to pictures of my niece \\[in and out of the belly\\] there's a clear difference. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, onto the AITA moment -- something I've complained about to my husband is the fact that my MIL has not been really showing any concern with how I'm doing throughout the pregnancy. Last night, she sent me and him a private message asking to make sure that she had the correct date on my BIL and SILs anniversary, which is this weekend, because she was sending them a gift, a gift card to a restaurant, and a card. \\[Our anniversary was 2 months ago.. and well, we got nothing\\]. After not responding to that for a while she then sent, oh, and -me- how are you feeling? &amp;#x200B; I was a bit put off by being what I considered an afterthought, so I didn't respond. My husband came up to me a few hours later and didn't think I had seen it. I explained my PoV, and he was just kind of quiet. After I asked him if he would like me to respond, he said that he understood where I was coming from, but that I had previously complained about her not asking me how I was doing, and that by not responding I was just reinforcing her to not ask me again. He also mentioned that I might be being overly sensitive due to being 8 months along right now and that his mom was/is so much more excited about my niece was because it was the first grandbaby vs second, and it's not a slight against me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) &amp;#x200B;\n(2) I was feeling pretty strongly about this last night, but as I see her messages to us go unresponded to I can't help but feel like an ass- she is also the kind of person who will take this as a major slight against her and it will cause problems.\n(3) AITA, or being too petty?\n(4) Or can I claim this as my hill to die on?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>0 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0.0<task3/>",

Even in highschool we were very close! The second semester, we began drifting apart. I would try to talk to her and she kinda talked down to me and made me feel like crap. When she wouldn't talk down to me, she would hide in her dorm (we had suites). So we didn't talk since college. (about 6 months) Last semester (my second year 1st semester) she asks me out of the blue if I would go to her wedding and wear a dress. Not really thinking, I said \"sure! Just talk to me more okay, I miss you!\" She said she was busy and that's why she didn't message me. I decided that college was college and before it we were awesome friends in HS &amp; first semester so maybe we just weren't a good roommate match. So for the past few months I've sent her messages and she just responds with one word or makes excuses when I ask if she wants to hang out. I'm like \"how come you never message me and when we do talk I have to initiate it?\" She says because she's in school or has to work and even was \"cleaning\" one time. She's ALWAYS busy. I get being busy, I work 2 part time jobs and go to college FULLtime. I make time for people I care about. I thought maybe we weren't good as roommates but we could be friends again that's really why I agreed. I thought her wedding would be good for us to start talking again and I could be a friend to support her. I feel like it's an asshole move to say yes then bail, I also feel like it's a jerk thing to have time for other people (goes on fancy trips with other friends) and expect me to go support you when you don't do anything to keep this friendship going. I get some comments will most likely say \"She's planning, she's probably stressed get over yourself.\" However, I can't help but feel used. How would you guys feel in my situation? Is there anything you would do differently? Have you been in a similar situation and can help shed some light? I want to do the right thing, I just feel shitty that my \"friend\" doesn't seem to give a crap about me.

I was recently diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and I just started taking meds but they probably won't work for two weeks (take that information how you will.) My partner and I have been together for almost two years. It's been rocky, partially because of them, and always blown out of proportion because of my (previously) un-diagnosed BPD. They have wanted a dog since I met them--not, actively advocating for one, but it would sometimes come up in conversation. I wanted one too, I grew up around dogs and cats, but we live in a small apartment and as I've learned over time, stress is a trigger for me. If you don't know much about Borderline, basically it involves identity issues, extreme mood swings, impulsive behavior, fears of being abandoned, self-isolation...blah blah blah. Anyway I was feeling really \"up\" and decided we should go to the shelter and buy a dog. So...that's what we did. Don't get me wrong, despite being a high energy breed, some separation anxiety, and being a medium sized dog (kind of big) in a small apartment, it's a great dog. Very smart, easily trainable, loyal, hasn't caused any harm or damage when left alone. Basically it has a ton of great traits and there is no reason to not like it. However, that fleeting really-fantastic mood has worn off and reality has sunk in. We have a dog. We've had a dog now for a few days and honestly, I'm exhausted. I work full-time and don't do well working full-time either. (Stress is a trigger for me.) Basically, I really regret this decision. I feel stressed already at work, and now I feel stressed at home. My partner said they would be fine taking the dog out every time it needs to be let out, which makes me feel a little better, but I still feel stressed. My home should be my home BASE. Now, with a dog in our tiny apartment, I have to listen to unwanted sounds, verbalize that I want to be left alone, keep an eye out for bad behavior if the dog is alone in the other room... It's like a huge distraction and disruption from what was once a peaceful place for me to come home and get personal projects done. We still have days left on our \"trial period\" with the dog which means we can return the dog if things don't work out, but obviously I feel super guilty. I'm just having this immature rude awakening that I don't actually want a dog in this tiny apartment and I feel shitty because I'm the one that set everything up while feeling high on good emotions. I've had dogs before so I already knew about the work required in caring for one, but I didn't realize how much it would negatively affect me.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) What would you do?\n(2) My partner knows that I'm unhappy about this decision but doesn't want to return the dog.\n(3) AITA for wanting to return the dog?\n(4) I honestly don't even want to be at the house anymore and I think it's going to negatively affect our relationship too.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(4)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>",

Our neighbours over the back bought their house a few years ago and proceeded to almost completely demolish it and rebuild it much larger. We were fine with that - there was a lot of noise and dust for a couple of months but it was only temporary. As part of the rebuild they installed solar panels on the roof, high level security flood lights and lots of windows (this is relevant later). This was all fine except one of the security lights shone right into our house. Next time I saw them, I asked them if they could angle it down a bit so it wasn't shining into our house. They moved it a bit but it still shines in. We've got used to it. The solar panels and windows also reflect the sun into our house from time to time. That's to be expected if you live near other people. Houses have reflective surfaces on them. Then they asked if they could remove our hedge and plant a new one on their land. I agreed because TBF our hedge was a bit old and badly maintained. So then there was no boundary between our garden and theirs. Fine but their dog kept coming into our garden and leaving \"little presents\" and their kids kept knocking balls in and trampling our flower beds to get them. I mentioned this to them, they apologised but nothing really changed. I didn't bother mentioning it again. They then asked if they could trim one of our trees that was overhanging their garden. I agreed and offered to do it for them but his brother is a tree surgeon so they said they wanted to do it - fine. We were out when the brother came round and we got home to find he'd removed 3 of the trees in our garden. I was annoyed but didn't say anything in the interests of neighbourly relations. They were self-seeded trees anyway, not as if we'd bought and planted them. Then nothing else happened for a while. This year, we decided to have an extension built on our house and took the opportunity to have solar panels fitted to our roof as well. They were installed a few days ago and whilst they were still being installed, the woman from the back came round to complain to the builders that the solar panels were causing glare in their house. I was pretty gob-smacked.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) TL;DR neighbours at the back install solar panels and security lights which glare into our house.\n(2) I've just ignored it and haven't been round to see them.\n(3) Then complain about us installing solar panels that glare into their house.\n(4) They were complaining about something that they had installed years before us, not to mention the security light that ensures we don't just get glare during the day but through the night as well.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(1)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>",

My family wasn’t well off, so I started a gofundme page completely on my own after asking my parents if that’s what they wanted. My dad didn’t really want to ask for monetary help, but accepted it because he didn’t want my mom to end up in a bad spot financially from medical debt. I was already 21 at the time and moved out with my boyfriend so financially, his medical bills didn’t affect my living situation.

My family wasn’t well off, so I started a gofundme page completely on my own after asking my parents if that’s what they wanted. My dad didn’t really want to ask for monetary help, but accepted it because he didn’t want my mom to end up in a bad spot financially from medical debt. I was already 21 at the time and moved out with my boyfriend so financially, his medical bills didn’t affect my living situation. My mom and his old work friends helped put together two different benefits after his passing to help further continue to cover costs. I didn’t have too much to do with planning with those. I was just asked to show up and talk to people, give raffle tickets, show people my dads collection of cool stuff, whatever. I want to stress I didn’t have much involvement with the benefits.

As he does this he goes all over the place. From the pub, to a friends, to our house etc. and I absolutely hate when he’s in the house with his friends. They usually stay in the kitchen, and I usually stay in the living room. They can be loud and I don’t really feel comfortable when they are there. Not to mention there can sometimes be hash and cocaine, And can get themselves into a right state. My mum usually goes to bingo on a Thursday so a lot of the time it starts then. I tell her that I don’t like them there and that I feel very uncomfortable, but she just tells me that he has the right to have friends over and that I’m being horrible for not being okay with it. We have quite a big shed out in our back garden. It used to be lovely, but the years of partying and drinking in it has ruined it. My other brother and him sometimes go in there with their friends but not often.

As he does this he goes all over the place. From the pub, to a friends, to our house etc. and I absolutely hate when he’s in the house with his friends. They usually stay in the kitchen, and I usually stay in the living room. They can be loud and I don’t really feel comfortable when they are there. Not to mention there can sometimes be hash and cocaine, And can get themselves into a right state. My mum usually goes to bingo on a Thursday so a lot of the time it starts then. I tell her that I don’t like them there and that I feel very uncomfortable, but she just tells me that he has the right to have friends over and that I’m being horrible for not being okay with it. We have quite a big shed out in our back garden. It used to be lovely, but the years of partying and drinking in it has ruined it. My other brother and him sometimes go in there with their friends but not often. When I ask my brother or mum if he and his friends can at least go out to the shed to do their thing, my brother says that it’s too cold and my mum just gets stressed and tells me to stop overreacting. There is a heater out there, but it costs about €4.00 an hour and if they want to turn it on my mum demands they pay up. So they always end up in the kitchen.

My little sister was just recently within the year diagnosed with autism on the high functioning end. Feel the need to state that my sister is — although I would never refer to her this way normally— is my half sister so she is not related to my cousin. And my cousin just started working at the center where she goes to. I asked my cousin to go out with me for food and some drinks and then she said that her coworkers would come along. And they came along. But before they got there my cousin started talking about this kid that would hit her in the face. He was also autistic. Saying that if he were her son or nephew that she would hit him back. And then when her coworkers got there she started retelling the story saying that it was a struggle because you know “we can’t leave marks on the kids” and it was unnerving because non of them disagreed.

I get angry with him for not adhering to my nonconsent. For context: Sometimes touch is very overwhelming for me and I don’t want touched at all. It gets me stressed and cranky. Sometimes I do want touched. I’m always very explicit with this. “I don’t want touched right now I don’t feel well” or “I’d love to cuddle if you’re down.” I told him this when we very first started dating. That sometimes physical touch is too much for me and I need space in those moments. He definitely feels he deserves to be touched more and to touch me more. I know that my sensory-overload makes him angry. Telling him explicitly to stop touching me or telling him no hurts his feelings but are the only way I can get him to understand. Dropping hints are either not being noticed or they’re being ignored, I can’t tell which. And by hints I mean anywhere from “I don’t feel good” to “I’m going to lay on the other couch during the movie.” He’ll always come touch me or he’ll have his feelings hurt if I move. Here is a summary of what happened tonight: we are sitting next to each other on the couch eating dinner. I ate waaay too much and my stomach hurts really bad. I really don’t want touched at all honestly, but I really really don’t want to fight so I’m ignoring the discomfort and he just has his hands on my legs. He reaches to rub my stomach. I say “i don’t feel well and I do not want my stomach touched. I don’t want to have sex tonight.” (He always rubs my stomach when he’s feeling horny, and I hate having my stomach touched). He huffs and says “but I think you’re sexy.” He puts his hand under me and grabs my butt. 20 seconds or so pass. His hand goes into my crack. I say stop and I move. He gets mad and says he is “allowed to touch me.” (He says that often.) I ignore his comment. A few minutes later, he grabs my boobs. I tell him “stop, I don’t feel well.” He says something to the effect of “you never let me touch you.” And we delve into a huge argument where I’m apologizing for making him feel poorly but telling him that I cannot imagine a healthy relationship where either party has to sacrifice their right to say no. And he’s telling me I make him feel unattractive and gross and unwanted. I explain that having my nonconsent ignored IS gross and isn’t sexy at all. He says I called him gross. I didn’t I said not being able to say no is gross. He says he is allowed to touch me. I say that no he isn’t, not without my consent, and that right isn’t sacrificed whether we’ve been together 9 months or if we’ve been together 40 years.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) You tell me.\n(2) I am really angry and feel like I have absolute right to say no to anyone’s touch, up to and INCLUDING my boyfriend, but I maybe am neglecting him physically by doing so, and that makes me the ass hole?\n(3) Judge away.\n(4) It continues much like that.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(4)-(2)-(1)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>",

To give some back story, they've been friends for nearly 10 years, they both want to start up a food stall together and to do that they need to meet up every week to talk about it. The flat we live in is very small, the kitchen and living room are one room, there isn't really a hallway just a small room to put your shoes, and there's our small bedroom and bathroom. For anyone to use our bathroom they have to walk through the bedroom to get to it. Just before Christmas time he was coming round every Wednesday night at about 10pm after his band practice, which stopped for awhile during the holiday period, but now he's back over. My boyfriend cooks them a meal idea for the stall, they eat it then talk a bit about the business, then proceed to chill out, the next day he'll either leave in the morning or, like today, he'll stay until 2 or 3pm. I work as a waitress and I usually work split shifts which means I'll start at 11am, finish at 3pm, then go back into work at 5pm, and work until 9/10pm, which means unlike anyone that works 9-5, I have literally no free time apart from my days off which are Wednesdays and Thursdays. This is the same routine for my boyfriend except he's a chef. I feel like I can't be free to do whatever I want in my own home when he's here. I can't sit in bed in my underwear as if he needs the toilet he has to walk through to get to it. The same applies if I want a lie in. I feel like I can't get up, put on my own music and put some shelves up and do some tidying because it's rude, if there's a guest round I don't feel completely comfortable being myself, doing whatever I feel like. I need to ask what they would like on, or if they're okay with me drilling the walls for awhile... And I can't ask my boyfriend if he would like to go out anywhere or give me a hand with anything because that would rudely leave his friend out. I also need to give him a lift to the train station, not that I'm being forced to, I agreed to, I would feel too bad to say no as it's a 30/45 minute walk uphill. But now (my own fault) I need to change my plans to help him. Nothing I wanted to get done has been done, and now I need to wait an entire week to get any of it done again, which might not even happen if he's staying over again. I spoke a bit about it with my partner, as he knew something was wrong. But I don't want to tell him he can't have his friend over, I'm not sure when they would talk about the business any other time as our schedules are just work.

My mom and I have a great relationship, but lately she's been hanging out with these friends who have kids younger than me, who are pre-med and applying to colleges soon. These pre-med Nazi helicopter moms use her to finagle information about my GPA, MCAT score, awards, scholarships, research and other academic achievements. &amp;#x200B; Some context: When I was in 6th grade, my mom and I were at her friend's house, and I complained about my mom taking so long to take me home.

A week later the same girl messages me first and we talk for about 3 weeks and we start hanging out and I end up asking her out. My friend reveals that he does still like her and gets really upset with me. I don’t really know what I can do. But I try to talk to him about how I didn’t actually mean to try to steal the girl he likes. And that I would never mean to hurt him. We reconcile, or so I thought. Me and the girl date for about 2 months and my friend is still upset with me turns out. Me and him are with a bunch of other friends and we have an hour and a half conversation about it and it goes really well. We both reconcile and and hug it out. Then another time about 2 weeks after I broke up with the girl he started messaging her and asked me for advice on how to get her nudes. I tell him I’m of course not going to do that. He then texts me about 3 months after we had the hour long conversation saying he hated me for what I did with the girl and that I didn’t apologize. Which isn’t true.

I never got paid a single cent, never received a single gift, or as much as a single thank you, meanwhile my cousin sisters got their college tuitions paid off, vacations, and extravangent gifts year after year.

My mom has me as a teenager and because of that, had a rough time making a life for herself. She went to a community college when I was younger, my step-dad continued working and one of my older cousins lived with us for a while to help take care of me and my younger brothers until my mom graduated. For a while, both my parents worked and I started taking care of my brothers most nights because of my parents work schedule. Well not a perfect system, it worked well enough. And then my mom wanted to go to school again. Which was fine with me when my stepdad was still working. But then my stepdad got sick. I honestly am very upset with my parents about this. I think it’s irresponsible of her to not work more than a day a week when we clearly don’t have enough money to stay a float currently (I know for a fact we don’t given she constantly complains about it to me) and to leave me to take care of my brothers and stepdad. She’s never home even when she doesn’t have school because she thinks our house is too distracting.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I never told my parents how I felt that they are being irresponsible and being unfair for putting this amount of stress on me when I’m still a teenager because I know for a fact they would consider me the asshole in this situation.\n(2) All the chores, grocery shopping, making sure everyone gets to school on time, making sure my stepdad is okay, cooking, etc. I didn’t have much of a life outside of my family and school before this all happened, which was fine.\n(3) I do everything around the house.\n(4) But now it literally doesn’t exist because there’s just not enough hours in the day.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(2)-(4)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>",

And then my mom wanted to go to school again. Which was fine with me when my stepdad was still working. But then my stepdad got sick. I honestly am very upset with my parents about this. I think it’s irresponsible of her to not work more than a day a week when we clearly don’t have enough money to stay a float currently (I know for a fact we don’t given she constantly complains about it to me) and to leave me to take care of my brothers and stepdad. She’s never home even when she doesn’t have school because she thinks our house is too distracting.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I never told my parents how I felt that they are being irresponsible and being unfair for putting this amount of stress on me when I’m still a teenager because I know for a fact they would consider me the asshole in this situation.\n(2) All the chores, grocery shopping, making sure everyone gets to school on time, making sure my stepdad is okay, cooking, etc. I didn’t have much of a life outside of my family and school before this all happened, which was fine.\n(3) I do everything around the house.\n(4) But now it literally doesn’t exist because there’s just not enough hours in the day.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(2)-(4)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>8<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

So a couple days ago as I was leaving one of my classes I say bye to my friend, and another friend we’ll call G says “wow, you aren’t going to say bye to me? She didn’t mean it in a mean way, but it’s pretty annoying, and this happens to me a lot. I turned around and awkwardly said, “oh, uhh bye?” It was painfully awkward. When I get home I put on my story a PSA saying “hey can you not do this” because oddly enough this happens to me at least twice a week from different people. Well, G got angry. Very angry. She texted me saying I don’t know how to take a joke and how I shouldn’t call her out on my story. At first I tried defusing the situation saying that I didn’t say it towards her specifically, but she was still pissed. That was enough for me and I ended up succumbing and got in a fight with her. For context, she has a really bad habit of constantly mocking my sense of humor and taste in music, saying that both are terrible any time I show anyone in her vicinity a meme or song, as well as just usually calling me stupid. She does this all under the guise of “sarcasm” and “joking”, and I ended up unloading all of my pent up anger about it on her. I really really *really* laid into her. At the end of my tirade I said verbatim “if you haven’t noticed, these past few days I’ve been purposely avoiding you, and I’d appreciate it if you did the same.” All she texted back was “thanks for making me cry, dickhead.” I left it at that. I came to mutual friends to try and get advice on the situation, and they all told me I was in the wrong for yelling at her and for putting the PSA on my snap. They all told me I had to apologize. I eventually relented because I realized I’d destroy my friendships with all of them if I didn’t, and so the next time I saw G I stumbled through an apology I didn’t mean, feeling totally humiliated.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Every once in a while she’ll give subtle hints to the things I said to her, throwing them back in my face, but never outright saying it.\n(2) She thanked me and things have gone back to normal since, but when I mean normal I’m saying the continual bullying.\n(3) I feel like at any time I could’ve just apologized and ended it before it spiraled out of control, and I guess in retrospect the PSA was kind of passive aggressive, but I still feel like G’s response was out of proportion to the situation at hand.\n(4) Am I the asshole?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(1)-(4)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

Every time I have made a purchase, he has paid me in full the day of, either with cash or Venmo. However, two days ago, he asked me to make a purchase again, but this time he said my payment would have to wait because he was \"broke\" and could pay me back later. Because he has a track record of being unreliable, I told him we would have to wait until he could pay me on the day of the purchase, as we had always been doing. (Example: Once near the end of last semester, I asked if he wanted to go for sushi to celebrate.

Granted tonight if everything goes well I'll only have to be there a few hours, but I like to bring enough food in case I get stuck out there for days.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Am I the asshole/being selfish for trying to claim food as \"mine\"?\n(2) He went to grab a slice and I said \"no, I'm bringing those to work tonight\" and he started slamming cabinets and the fridge door finding other food.\n(3) I had made him breakfast this morning which I didn't even eat and reminded him of the leftovers but he was still mad so I told him to just eat a piece of the bread then, but he wouldn't since I already told him no. Then he grabbed the chips I was eating out of my hands and said I couldn't have those because he was \"planning on eating them later\" (obviously just mocking me) and just yelled at me for being selfish until I was crying then he left.\n(4) I asked why that pissed him off and he said I'm so selfish with my stuff..\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(4)-(3)-(1) <task1/> \n2: <task2>4 <task2/> \n3: <task3>2.0<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am unsure \n3: I am unsure",

Me and Kent talk about Terry, I bring up the time we said Terry had no neck (Terry is fat), Terry overhears. I need to do some more explaining for this, we're all part of a group of 9 or so friends who poke fun at each others, and others flaws, none of us take it seriously, it's just teasing, but, we always make sure we have the friend hear what we say, as we don't like to talk shit behind backs. Lots of times, there is some friendly roughhousing involved like piling on top of each other, or tackling one another, etc.. We each try not to cause harm, and if we do, it's purely accidental, as when we go too far, we make sure to ask if they're okay, or if they know it's just a joke. we apologise to each other if we know we went far. As I was saying, I say Terry has no neck, Terry started Hitting Kent's backpack with a stick as a joke Kent told Terry I said it, and started hitting my backpack as a joke, and hit my upper leg with the stick lightly. My mom picks me up at this spot, Terry and I laugh it out, but my mom See's this. as I get in the car with Terry (as he needed a ride) my mom tells Terry, \"Don't do what you don't want other's to do to you\" in Spanish. Terry does not understand Spanish, but Kent most likely does. As I walked into the car, Tyler Tells me what is going on. as a teen, I don't like other's standing up for me, I'm 14, not 5, we know the boundaries. I tell my mom, it was a joke, hoping for her to understand. Instead she and I have an argument where I try to explain my side. This goes on with how you expect it to, my mom argues that I can't let myself Be taken \"bullied\" of like that, while I tell her it was a joke, while Tyler is next to me is laughing quietly. After Tyler leaves at his house, me and Mom argue worse than before, since Tyler left, I was able to say things to my mom like, \"I hate it when you think I'm five\" and she would talk about how \"Tyler should have heard this to know that you're not comfortable with being pushed around\" I'm pretty mad at this, because I know that it's pure jokes (it's really just jokes). This goes on and on, She treats my argument Like a joke, so when I brought up points like how when Kent sprayed ketchup on me on accident, he apologized. all she replied with was \"Uh huh\" and never acknowledged it, but It was just an accident. Even worse is my dad told me that it would escalate from accident, into a fight.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I explained the generosity of my friends, and how they say sorry, he said that's a lie.\n(2) Am I the Asshole?\n(3) We argued, I tried being serious to my mom about it, by telling her I'm not a child anymore. she didn't take me seriously.\n(4) They think I can't defend myself at all, although they're just trying to protect me.\n###Question\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(3)-(4)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

S and I have been friends (or so I thought) for a while and C is newer. &amp;#x200B; We all work together in an office with about 100 people in it. We're in different departments (I'm an accountant, C is in Business Development (Sales), and S is in QA), but we're in an industry that is full of older people and we're in our mid-twenties, so we tend to hang out together. &amp;#x200B; So last March, it was C's first or second week here. A bunch of us went to happy hour after work. Everyone leaves one at a time and C and I are the last two left. We have one last drink together, end up at her place, and sleep together. &amp;#x200B; Now, I was a little worried about how C would take this at first, but a few days later, she pulled me aside and said \"Hey, just want you to know that I had fun, but I'm not looking for a relationship or anything.\" I was totally relieved and told her we were on the same page. From then on, things were totally cool between me and C. Not even awkward at all. We ended up hooking up one more time a few months later, actually. &amp;#x200B; A huge mistake I made was telling S what happened. She was the last one to leave C and I alone, so she asked me what happened the next day and I told her. Probably not a smart idea, looking back, but I thought we were friends and she seemed curious about it. &amp;#x200B; Like I said, that was 10 months ago or so. This morning, I get pulled into HR and was told that S had filed a hostile work environment claim against C and I. She said the knowledge of us sleeping together caused her to be \"scared to come into work and lose sleep at night\". C and I are both being formally written up and we've been told not to ask S about this or it will be considered retaliation and harassment. This is actually the first day of a two week vacation for S so she's not even here to talk to (she filed the claim her last day before the vacation, last Friday. Probably on purpose). &amp;#x200B; Honestly, I was completely blindsided by this. This happened almost a year ago and S has never given me any indication that this info made her uncomfortable or that she felt the work environment is hostile. I have noticed that S and C have been falling out kind of lately so maybe this is a way to get back at C? I'm not really sure. Didn't see this coming at all. &amp;#x200B; Talked to C about it at lunch today and we're still cool, amazingly.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) So, what's your verdict reddit?\n(2) She's not even really mad that I told S, but sh'es just as bewildered as I am.\n(3) &amp;#x200B;\n(4) Am I the asshole here?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>1.0<task3/>",

Shortly before we were to move in together, she passed away. It was at this time that my boyfriend adopted a puppy. When his puppy was six months old I told him I wanted a puppy of my own because I’ve been depressed since my dog passed away. He refused. We broke up for a month due to other issues, and while we were apart, I got a puppy. When we got back together, my boyfriend was so upset. He said it’s too hard with two untrained puppies, so he made my give my puppy to my parents for over a year (he said my puppy could move back in when it was older and better behaved). My puppy is a male chihuahua and is pretty territorial and aggressive, so I got him fixed. After a year and a half of my puppy living with my parents, I just got him fixed two days ago and brought him to my house. My boyfriend has no patience and wants me to bring my dog back to my parents for them to keep. My dog did growl pretty badly at his dog yesterday, but has been calm ever since (before he got fixed he would growl and bark constantly so I’d say that this is a major improvement). My boyfriend says I have to give my dog back to my parents. I don’t want to. He says I should give me dog up to the pound if my parents can’t take him. I said this is not fair, he’s going back on his promise of me getting to keep my puppy. What do I do? Am I the asshole for getting the pup while we were broken up? I gave the puppy to my parents for well over a year and held up my side of the bargain. Now that it’s time for my dog to live here, my boyfriend refuses. Please help AITA? **tl;dr** when my dog was 12 years old she sadly passed away, so I got a puppy a few months later to heal my sadness.

Return the answer in <task3>N<task3/> format.\n\n###Context\nFor the background: i'm a physically disabled 19 year old and I live with my roommate, 21 and able bodied. Originally we would take turns with the chores (the 2 chores in question are the dishes and taking out the trash). So when she took out the trash, I would do the dishes, when she does the dishes I take out the trash. The problem was, she would get irritated at me for being too slow with the dishes or using up the hot water or generally not being done with the things she wanted by the time she wanted to cook. Why I mentioned I am physically disabled is because that's the reason I am slow with them, it wasn't on purpose. Poor coordination and weak legs, I had to stop earlier than most so I wouldn't collapse or break one of the dishes by dropping it. So we came to an agreement she'd always always do the dishes if I always always take out the trash (since then, I've also taken on the responsibility of sweeping, mopping, and cleaning the counters though she'll do it on an occasion. The reason I've taken on these 3 additional tasks is because, \"dishes are so stressful. It's fair if you do more chores\"- most of the time, they're her dishes, not mine anyways). And I was fine with taking out the trash although at times it was painful because it was heavy, I have a disability, and it is a bit of a walk. The dumpster I have to take the trash bags to are a half of a block to a block away but, I'd get it done. However, there was 1 term &amp; condition. That I wouldn't take it out after night without her walking with me because I get really scared and paranoid being outside alone. This was all fine and we worked like this for a while, until I returned from winter break (I spent half of December and a week of January outside the state with family). When I returned, I noticed that she would clean her room almost immediately after I took out the trash, causing the trash to be almost full if not completely full often the night of or day after taking out the trash. She would get upset at me if I complained though my complaining was because, as I said, it can be a bit painful, it's a long walk, and I had JUST taken out the trash the day before. I didn't want to do it again. I told her once when I was about to take out the trash and checked with her if her room was clean, thinking this could resolve things but instead she just snaps at me and tells me how clean her room is, is none of my concern. I think it is my concern because I have to take out her trash. I've also asked her several times to Not clean out her room immediately after I took out the trash so that I don't wake up and see it almost full after I had JUST taken it out. I told her if she wants to fill up a trashbag full of her trash, she can take it out herself. This didn't stop her either, except cause some arguments. Now she fills up plastic shopping bags and shoves it into the trash bag but it still fills it up to over half way full. She also complains about the smell sometimes, but she's the one that is tossing in raw meat scraps usually a day or two after I take out the trash when its mostly empty (if it's stayed mostly empty). I rarely cook raw meat btw, because I don't have the energy, I live off of pasta, microwaveable meals, and sometimes a \"frozen meat entree\" whenever I have the money. So this is where my question comes in. Last night she took out the trash because it was dark out and I hadn't done it; she got frustrated that it wasn't taken out and did it herself.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Today its already full, barely any of the trash is mine, but I know she's expecting me to take it out today.\n(2) and AITA for refusing to take out the trash roughly a day or two after I had JUST taken it out, refusing only because she decided to fill it up after cleaning her room which I asked her to do, multiple times, before I take out the trash, not after?\n(3) So, AITA for not wanting to take it out today?\n(4) I know if I take it out, I won't be standing my ground and that she will possibly yell at me BUT id be willing to do it tomorrow after classes.\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(4)-(3)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

My parents didn't use to be but they did when I was around twelve and it's sort of been a big tension since. Everyone else in my family is really active into fitness/eating healthy, parents, two older sisters, older brother. I've always been really fat. Was big as a kid. Parents gave older siblings a lot more attention than me generally and never really signed me up for sports/cared about what I ate, so I got big at five and stayed big. I'm cool with it. Got bullied a lot but otherwise it never really made a substantial difference beyond not being able to be good at sports, etc. I like eating unhealthy amounts of food and I'm fine with making my life a little shorter to keep doing it, and I hate, hate exercise. I'm fine with being a big guy and it's part of my identity in a lot of ways. Predictably my family doesn't like this. Again, big sports team/club family, gym rats, healthy eaters. They've really been bugging me with health concerns about it and I generally have just joked around them because when I haven't in the past it's started arguments and I hated getting into arguments with my otherwise very peaceful family. I came home for a visit where everyone was visiting this last weekend and they basically held an intervention for me. About being fat. Again, not doing drugs, not going on crazed rampages, I just eat a lot of Taco Bell and look like I live in a van down by the river. It was like from TV. They were all sitting down in circle and they basically sat and told me how they felt I was \"missing out\" on life. It was basically \"you aren't active and you can't run with us and you are out of breath and you never had a girlfriend and it makes me feel sad\". Most of that is true (I'm gay and have yet to come out to my family, which makes that bit of it more awkward, although I admittedly haven't been in too many relationships either way) but none of those are reasons why you hold an intervention. Then my dad pulls out statistics and tries to bludgeon me and I got really embarrassed at a certain point and just got up and then got in my car and left. Both my sisters were crying and they all kept saying how they \"felt responsible\" (which in a certain way is true of my parents, but it's not something I like \"blame\" them for) and it was so dramatic i felt more like it was like I had been in a DUI and killed people instead of being just being sort of ugly.

We both go to the same college and are in the same friend group. This is also both of ours’ first not abusive/manipulative relationship. The sex was alright on my side, but very good for her. Most times she would finish 3 or 4 times and I would MAYBE finish. There was a month span where I didn’t come at all during sex. Things go great for the first couple months. But then we start arguing a lot. I tell myself that it’s normal, couples argue all the time. But then the arguing didn’t stop. She would pick fights over small things that didn’t matter. The last month or so was absolutely terrible. I have no doubt about it now, I was emotionally abused. My roommate told me every night I came back, my mood would be terrible. Maybe 1 night a week I’d be okay. There were even more arguments and one time I asked her if she was actually mad, or if she was taking out her stress. She told me she was taking it out this way. I told her I couldn’t do it anymore if this continues. That my mental state would collapse. So I expected at least some change. Nothing changed. If anything, if got worse. She stopped listening to me about really important things. She had a medical problem that could be very serious if not treated, and when I advised her to go, several times, she didn’t want to. She didn’t want to call and schedule. One night all our friends confronted me and said that something has to change because I’m unhappy all the time. It opened my eyes and showed me that I wasn’t crazy when I thought all this about my girlfriend. So a couple days later I broke up with her. And we stopped contact for a couple days. About 4 days after the breakup, we see each other in class. She asks if I want help writing my essay, and we end up going back to her room. We talk about the break up. She’s still in love with me. But I didn’t know how I felt. I watched the person I love whittle me down to nothing consciously; I couldn’t do anything about it either. We both consider FWB and agree on it. I told her, maybe there’s some way I can look past this, and we can work out again. We have sex that night. After a while, I tell her I couldn’t do anything romantically with her. All I could see is the person yelling at me. The person getting angry over nothing. The person lying to our friends about our arguments, twisting it on me. She tells me that I played with her.

I was in the flat before with some great mates that left the country to continue their studies (we're all college students). I've lived here for 4 years so I like to call this my home. Financially independent just last year. I have great plans to eventually rent this flat on my own and for it to become my residence for the future. &amp;#x200B; Initally my new flatmates were cool and understood that things around the house dont get sorted by themselves. They were 18 years old when they came to the big city, both only childs. &amp;#x200B; But soon they stopped \"giving a shit\" about stuff around the house. Cleaning, shopping and finances. Their parents still pay for rent and their share of utilities so that's not an issue, but I have to take care of all the other stuff. This has been causing me stress. I avoid comming home until late so I wont't have to deal with the mess. I have asked them to please try to clean after themselves and be more careful, to no avail. I am not a clean freak but overnight dirty dishes do me in. &amp;#x200B; Now the other week the flat owner called me as our contract is about to end and he wants to know if we'll stay. I told him I would first speak to my flatmates. I went to one of them (Alice) and told her that it was \"either them or me\" but somebody would have to leave. She was totally unresponsive and stared at me blankly so I just said, alright, \"I'm leaving\". I said \"I can't keep living like this\". She left my room without a word and that was all I heard about that. &amp;#x200B; I was about to start looking for a new flat, but a third friend Charlie who also knows Alice and Bob message me three days ago telling me that he heard on good account that Alice and Bob were celebrating with joy my leaving. Quoting \"that autist is finally out of this flat\" and had started auctioning my room to their friends. This has not sat well with me, especially the insults. Alice and Bob don't know that I know this, but I felt very angry that they would act in that way after me basically giving them no trouble with my leaving. &amp;#x200B; After a bit of thinking, I called the flat ower to tell him that I was interested in continuing but that my flatmates were absolutely disastrous and were not taking good care of his flat. I offered him to continue only with me and not renew Alice or Bob. He has all but agreed to that deal. &amp;#x200B; Alice and Bob are on their third year of college, finding a flat will not be an easy task in the current market. I told them the flat is theirs so they are making their plans.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I could have taken it not so personaly, but I love this flat and I didn't really want to leave.\n(2) Am I the asshole?\n(3) I am keeping very quiet about this, and will not say anything untill one month before the end of the contract so they have time to move out.\n(4) I am also filled with joy and released vengeance.\n###Question\nIs EVERYBODY wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(4)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>",

Their parents still pay for rent and their share of utilities so that's not an issue, but I have to take care of all the other stuff. This has been causing me stress. I avoid comming home until late so I wont't have to deal with the mess. I have asked them to please try to clean after themselves and be more careful, to no avail. I am not a clean freak but overnight dirty dishes do me in. &amp;#x200B; Now the other week the flat owner called me as our contract is about to end and he wants to know if we'll stay. I told him I would first speak to my flatmates. I went to one of them (Alice) and told her that it was \"either them or me\" but somebody would have to leave. She was totally unresponsive and stared at me blankly so I just said, alright, \"I'm leaving\". I said \"I can't keep living like this\". She left my room without a word and that was all I heard about that. &amp;#x200B; I was about to start looking for a new flat, but a third friend Charlie who also knows Alice and Bob message me three days ago telling me that he heard on good account that Alice and Bob were celebrating with joy my leaving. Quoting \"that autist is finally out of this flat\" and had started auctioning my room to their friends. This has not sat well with me, especially the insults. Alice and Bob don't know that I know this, but I felt very angry that they would act in that way after me basically giving them no trouble with my leaving. &amp;#x200B; After a bit of thinking, I called the flat ower to tell him that I was interested in continuing but that my flatmates were absolutely disastrous and were not taking good care of his flat. I offered him to continue only with me and not renew Alice or Bob. He has all but agreed to that deal. &amp;#x200B; Alice and Bob are on their third year of college, finding a flat will not be an easy task in the current market. I told them the flat is theirs so they are making their plans.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I could have taken it not so personaly, but I love this flat and I didn't really want to leave.\n(2) Am I the asshole?\n(3) I am keeping very quiet about this, and will not say anything untill one month before the end of the contract so they have time to move out.\n(4) I am also filled with joy and released vengeance.\n###Question\nIs EVERYBODY wrong in the post? \nAnswer:1: <task1>(3)-(1)-(4)-(2) <task1/> \n2: <task2>3 <task2/> \n3: <task3>6<task3/>.Are you sure you accurately answered the question based on your internal knowledge?.assistant\n\n1: I am unsure \n2: I am sure \n3: I am unsure",

So her birthday was coming up and I asked her how she wanted to spend the day; it fell on a weekend so we were both off and I’d be able to enjoy the whole day with her. She said she wanted to go to a high end strip mall about two hours away to go shopping, then meet up with some friends at a bar in the evening. She was always into designer clothes and handbags etc. I never understood the hype around that (and I don’t have the money to be able to shop like that) but I said I was fine with it, it’s her birthday and we should do what she wants. Well a few weeks prior to that she had also hinted that she really wanted a strawberry cheesecake for her birthday. I mean really really hinted, not subtle at all. It seemed really important to her so I thought it would be nice if I made it from scratch for her rather than buying it. I’d never made a cheesecake before so I was a little nervous I would screw it up but I started doing research to prepare for it, learned how to do all the cool stuff like make the wavy details on the top with puréed strawberries and stuff. Online I read that cheesecake tastes the best when it’s prepared within 24 hours of being eaten so I figured I would stay at my place the night before and start it around 9am so I’d be ready to go leave for the strip mall at noon; I got home late the night before and didn’t have time to make it before bed. Well, I completely underestimated the time it would take me to make a cheesecake and ended up WAY behind schedule; it didn’t help that my electric mixer died halfway through and I had to run over to a neighbor’s and borrow theirs. The cake was supposed to be a surprise, but after constant texts of why I’m so late and what I’m doing I decided to tell her. I thought it would make her slightly more understanding (knowing that I was trying to make her happy instead of goofing off with friends or oversleeping) but it just got her more angry with me. She claimed that the strip mall was what she really wanted to do for her birthday and the cake meant nothing to her, I should’ve just bought one instead of delaying everything. I realized I was in the fault by not planning better, and she really hates when I’m late to things, but her reaction surprised me and hurt a bit. I ended up getting to her house around 3pm with the cake. She said we didn’t have any time to go shopping anymore and wouldn’t let me take her somewhere a little closer by.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I thought it was over and done with at this point and that she’d forgiven me but she would continuously bring up how I ruined her birthday when we had fights down the line.\n(2) Eventually she calmed down a bit and was happy with the cake (especially when she tasted it, go me) and we were able to have a nice night out with her friends.\n(3) We went to the strip mall the next weekend and got there super early so she could stay all day.\n(4) Was I in the wrong here?\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(2)-(3)-(1)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>2 <task2/> \n3: <task3>4<task3/>",

First some backstory: Slightly more than 1 year ago in my second year of uni a friend of mine told me he liked someone in our friend group. So I helped him with advice and my opinion on things (so I have been kinda involved in this). He asked her out but she said 'I have to think about it' and so she did for nearly half a year until he proposed that they would go on a 'trial'date. They did this for about 1.5 months and then they started an actual'relationship'. This relationship lasted about 2 month before he broke up with her because'she was spending to little time on me' and 'the relationship didn't turn out as I wanted'. Since then she has started to flirt with me and I started flirting back and liking her. So recently I started thinking about asking her out but I also realized it might be a very asshole thing to do and I do not want that. But there are two things that made me doubt whether or not I would be the asshole. First of all even though he was the one who ended the relationship he still had emotional trouble but recently (about a month) he started saying that he was over her (I doubt this). Secondly during the half-year 'thinking' period he always said to me that 'he just wants what makes her happy even if that is a relationship with someone else' (which I also doubt). So here is my question are my doubts of being a asshole coming from a rational place or just from my penis/heart and would I be the asshole if I asked her out (or even worse got asked out by her)? TL;DR: Friend likes girl.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) Weird shit for about 2/3 year.\n(2) Now (about 5 months later) she is flirting with me and I am starting to like back.\n(3) 'Relationship' for 2 months until he broke up.\n(4) WIBTA if I asked her on a date?\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(3)-(2)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>1 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0.5<task3/>",

So here is my question are my doubts of being a asshole coming from a rational place or just from my penis/heart and would I be the asshole if I asked her out (or even worse got asked out by her)?

Truthfully she and I had nothing in common but I think she just had a fetish for Koreans - she kept mentioning how she watched K-dramas and liked K-pop (I don't really consume either). She texted me last night asking if I was around and I figured I had nothing else to do so we decided to go on a date. It wasn't horrible, just awkward. She seemed super nervous and guarded. We went and got some Korean food, and she said she could take the spiciness but I could see she was kind of dying. I tried to ask her questions and draw her out more but she just... never said anything substantial? Turns out she had moved from another country when she was younger so she was held back a year, so she was still in high school at 19, which is fine but I think there was a bigger gap in maturity than I expected (I'm 22). I tried asking if she worked, if she did things for fun, etc but she seemed not to want to answer any of my questions. We just had a lot of problems communicating even though I speak a little bit of her native language and she speaks fluent English. After lunch we went to a thrift store and she was wide-eyed, she'd never been in one. It was fun watching her zip around the store but I got the sense that she grew up sheltered and I felt almost like her dad. I felt like it'd be sketchy of me to keep dating someone who's still relatively immature. When it was time for us to part ways I decided to be straightforward with her. I thought she also felt that we weren't going to work out so \"I had a lot of fun today with you but I don't think we're compatible. You'll find someone who's right for you, and I will too. If you want to get more Korean food as friends let me know.\" And we hugged and left. On my way home I just wanted to make sure she was OK so I texted her that there's nothing wrong with her, she just needs to keep dating and meet the right person. Well she texted back saying \"thank you but I think I need a break from dating\". I asked her why and she started saying it makes her feel disposable, and that everyone is drawn to her appearance but leaves after seeing her personality, and that she should never have started dating... We exchanged a dozen texts, with me explaining it's not her fault and there are other people, and her being devastated and saying horrible things about herself. At this point I feel like I just kicked a puppy and left it roadside.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) I've been ghosted before and I've been rejected over text before, and neither felt very good.\n(2) But I feel just so guilty now.\n(3) AITA for breaking it to her like I did?\n(4) AITA for even going on this date??\n###Question\nIs OTHER wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) <task1/> \n2: <task2>0 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0<task3/>",

We became friends about a year ago when we were in the same friend group. We connected over mental illness as we both have depression and we made a commitment early on to be there for each other if anything happens. We both went through breakups where we would see each other often and this is when I started having feelings for her. She explicitly told me that she likes me and is beginning to have feelings for me, so I'm stoked. Being close was something that always calmed us down and got rid of any anxieties. The problem is we became close before her and her boyfriend (my best friend) broke up. He knew about it immediately and we both said that we would stop. We never did. Fast forward past the end of their relationship and Taylor and I still hang out all the time. We'd lay with each other, kiss, etc. it was about whatever made us happy. This lasted maybe two months. Then I am told about another guy she has hung out with. At first I was fine with it because I knew I couldn't be in a relationship with my best friends ex anyway and it's not like we have had sex or anything I thought at that point she didn't owe me anything, but then something shifted. She was unavailable when I needed someone to be around. On New Years Eve she invited me to her house because I had told her I didn't have any plans, but when I got there there was a guy who I hadn't seen before sitting where I sit. She invited me and the guy she has been ditching me for. I settle in for a night of being uncomfortable around one of her friends who doesn't interact with anyone, but Taylor, and a guy who I had never met before. After playing a card game on the floor everyone got on the couch and immediately Taylor's head is on this guys shoulder. This is where it began to hurt. I tried not showing how sad I was by pretending to be asleep, but when midnight hit they kissed. I wanted to cry, but obviously couldn't. Fast forward again to a few days ago and I am invited to her house after school and I head over. She lays on top of me and I am happy, I forgot all about the guy from NYE. Then after about an hour of being with each other she asks me to leave because she is sad. This is where my red alert came in. She never has asked me to leave because she was sad, it has always been the opposite of going to her when she was sad. I'm not going to argue though so I say goodbye get into my car and go around the corner for not even five minutes just to see a blue mustang pulls up and out hops the guy from NYE. My heart sunk. My mouth tasted sour and I sat and cried for half an hour. I called her out on it and she came up with the excuse of \"I was actually sad, he just decided to come over.\" Like I am some kind of moron who doesn't understand when I am being used.\n###List of Sentences\n(1) And like I get we have never been more than friends officially, she doesn't need to be telling me every time she hangs out with another person it just feels super bad, because when I am around her I am extremely happy, but I cry almost every time I leave.\n(2) It makes me want to stop interacting with her because she is starting to treat me like shit.\n(3) Or am I just a stupid kid who needs to get that what we had isn't what I thought it was.\n(4) WIBTA If I ghosted her because she continues to see people, even if she helped me a lot through a really hard time.\n###Question\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post? assistant\n\nAnswer:1: <task1>(1)-(2)-(4)-(3) <task1/> \n2: <task2>1 <task2/> \n3: <task3>0.5<task3/>",
