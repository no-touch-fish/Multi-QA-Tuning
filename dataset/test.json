{"question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?", "answer": "How much did the house cost? ** The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHow much did the repairs increase the value of the house? ** He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nWhat is the new value of the house? ** So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nHow much profit did he make? ** So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000"}
